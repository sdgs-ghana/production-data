A growth in passenger and freight volumes shows a robust infrastructure development happening in States and Regions along with the resultant socio-economic benefit. Air Transport is particularly important not only for the economic and job benefits but also because it is one of the only mode of transport that can be relied on during emergencies and disease outbreaks to reach food, medicines, medical personnel, vaccines and other supplies speedily to the affected persons in the affected areas. In addition, tracking how the non-road share of freight volumes, and the public transport share of passenger volumes, changes over time allows insights into the overall sustainability of the global transport system. The volume of international maritime freight and container port traffic movements provide an overall indication of the importance of port infrastructure for trade and development and may be relied upon to infer the quality and adequacy of seaports and their hinterland connections. Maritime transport is the dominant mode of international freight transport when flows are measured in volume terms. </p>","COVERAGE":"<p>This data is disaggregated by mode of transport.</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-13","composite_breakdown_label":"Mode of Transport","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Passenger and freight volumes, by mode of transport","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Passenger and freight volumes, by mode of transport","target_name":"Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all","indicator_number":"9.1.2","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-09-01-02.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 375 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Railways Development (MRD)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2016,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www.mrd.gov.gh/downloads/MoRD_2021_Annual_Progress_Report.pdf","source_url_text_1":"Ministry of Railways Development (MRD) Annual Progress Report, 2022","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"development@mrd.gov.gh","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Ministry of Railways Development (MRD)","source_periodicity_2":"Annual","source_earliest_available_2":"","source_geographical_coverage_2":"Ghana","source_url_2":"https://mofep.gov.gh/sites/default/files/pbb-estimates/2021/2021-PBB-MoT.pdf","source_url_text_2":"Ministry of Transport (MoT) Annual Progress Report, 2021","source_release_date_2":"","source_next_release_2":"","source_statistical_classification_2":"Official","source_contact_2":"info@mot.gov.gh","source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"target_number":"9.1","goal_number":"9","indicator_sort_order":"09-01-02"}
