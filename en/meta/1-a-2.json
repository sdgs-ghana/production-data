Pro-poor social spending is defined if the proportion of government expenditures on social services is higher than the proportion of the population, measured at the level determined by national definition of income/consumption poverty (consistent with SDG 1.2.1). For instance, if the proportion of public spending received by the poor exceeds (falls below) the proportion of poor as defined by national definitions, public expenditures can be interpreted as pro-poor (not pro-poor). This is a strong measurement of the financial commitment governments make to target their services and transfers on the poor groups of society, reinforcing pro-poor development strategies.</p><p>Further developments of the methodology and improvements in data availability may allow to expand this indicator to other vulnerable groups, such as women and children.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>The data has no disaggregation</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/\">SDG Indicators \u2014 SDG Indicators (un.org)</a></p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-10-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-10-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/999e04a95bda4aa30b6b71384e6445230c2e1b5f","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percent","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Proportion of total government spending on essential services (education, health and social protection)","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Proportion of total government spending on essential services (education, health and social protection)","target_name":"Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced development cooperation, in order to provide adequate and predictable means for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, to implement programmes and policies to end poverty in all its dimensions","indicator_number":"1.a.2","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UNESCO-UIS)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-0a-02.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 894 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2016,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://mofep.gov.gh/publications/programme-based-budgeting","source_url_text_1":"Programme Based Budgeting - Ministries of Health, Education and Gender, Children and Social Protection","source_release_date_1":2022,"source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@mofep.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"1.a.2","target_id":"1.a","sdg_goal":"1","indicator_sort_order":"01-0a-02"}
