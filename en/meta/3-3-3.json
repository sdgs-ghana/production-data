These data also serves to inform global resource allocation for malaria such as when defining eligibility criteria for Global Fund finance.</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>Complete data on malaria cases reported through surveillance systems are the best source of data but are rarely available for large populations. Reported data on malaria cases generally need to be corrected for extent of health service use, incompleteness of reporting and lack of case confirmation. In high transmission areas with limited health service data but with good data on parasite prevalence the number of cases can be estimated from parasite prevalence. The denominator is estimated, using risk mapping and population data.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>The data has not been disaggregated</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p>https://www.who.int/health-topics/malaria#tab=tab_1</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-10-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-10-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/999e04a95bda4aa30b6b71384e6445230c2e1b5f","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Per 1,000 population","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Malaria incidence per 1,000 population","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Malaria incidence per 1,000 population","target_name":"By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases","indicator_number":"3.3.3","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"World Health Organisation (WHO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-03-03-03.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 431 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Health","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2018,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www.moh.gov.gh/annual-reviews/","source_url_text_1":"Holistic Assessment of Health Sector Programme of Work","source_release_date_1":2018,"source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@moh.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"3.3.3","target_id":"3.3","sdg_goal":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-03-03"}
