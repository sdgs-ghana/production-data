Participation in early childhood and in primary education are both included. The age range will vary by country depending on the official age of entry to primary education.</p><p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p><p>An organized learning programme is one which consists of a coherent set or sequence of educational activities designed with the intention of achieving pre-determined learning outcomes or the</p><p>accomplishment of a specific set of educational tasks. Early childhood and primary education programmes are examples of organized learning programmes.</p><p>Early childhood and primary education are defined in the 2011 revision of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED 2011). Early childhood education is typically designed with a holistic approach to support children\u2019s early cognitive, physical, social and emotional development and to introduce young children to organized instruction outside the family context. Primary education offers learning and educational activities designed to provide students with fundamental skills in reading, writing and mathematics and establish a solid foundation for learning and understanding core areas of knowledge and personal development. It focuses on learning at a basic level of complexity with little, if any, specialisation.</p><p>The official primary entry age is the age at which children are obliged to start primary education according to national legislation or policies. Where more than one age is specified, for example, in different parts of a country, the most common official entry age (i.e. the age at which most children in the country are expected to start primary) is used for the calculation of this indicator at the global level.</p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Percent</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>MICS 2011, 2017</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>Ghana Statistical Service</p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<p>Ghana Statistical Service</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>The indicator measures children\u2019s exposure to organized learning activities in the year prior to the start of primary school.
