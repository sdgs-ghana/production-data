Its central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise of this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>Total GHG emissions are calculated as the sum of emissions of direct GHGs: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), measured in units of CO2-equivalent, by using a common weighting factor, <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials\">the Global Warming Potentials (GWP).</a></p>","COVERAGE":"<p>This data is disaggregated by emission source.</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-13-02-02.pdf\">SDG Indicators \u2014 SDG Indicators (un.org)</a></p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-13","composite_breakdown_label":"Emission source/sink","computation_units":"Metric Tonnes of CO2-equivalent","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Total greenhouse gas emissions per year","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Total greenhouse gas emissions per year","target_name":"Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning","indicator_number":"13.2.2","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"UN Climate Change (UNFCCC Secretariat)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=13&Target=13.2","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals metadata for target 13.2","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)","source_periodicity_1":"","source_earliest_available_1":1990,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/gh_BUR3_1282021_submission.pdf","source_url_text_1":"Ghana\u2019s Third Biennial Update Report, 2021","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@epa.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"target_number":"13.2","goal_number":"13","indicator_sort_order":"13-02-02"}
