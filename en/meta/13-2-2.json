Estimating the levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals is an important element of the efforts to achieve this objective.</p><p>In accordance with Articles 4 and 12 of the Climate Change Convention and the relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties, countries that are Parties to the Convention submit national GHG inventories to the Climate Change secretariat. These submissions are made in accordance with the reporting requirements adopted under the Convention, such as the revised \u201cGuidelines for the preparation of national communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention, Part I: UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual greenhouse gas inventories\u201d (decision 24/CP.19) for Annex I Parties and \u201cGuidelines for the preparation of national communications for non-Annex I Parties\u201d (decision 17/CP.8). The inventory data are provided in the annual GHG inventory submissions by Annex I Parties and in the national communications and biennial update reports by non-Annex I Parties.</p><p>The Paris Agreement adopted in 2015 marks the latest step in the evolution of the UN climate change regime and builds on the work undertaken under the Convention. Its central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Agreement also aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change.</p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Mt CO2-equivalent</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>Ghana\u2019s Third Biennial Update Report, 2021</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<p>Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>See 2a.</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>Total GHG emissions are calculated as the sum of emissions of direct GHGs: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), measured in units of CO2-equivalent, by using a common weighting factor, the so-called Global Warming Potentials (GWP).</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/\">SDG Indicators \u2014 SDG Indicators (un.org)</a></p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-10-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-10-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/8b48184d7d6b6f550c672990684c4b8b7bf3b580","composite_breakdown_label":"Emission source/sink","computation_units":"Metric Tonnes of CO2-equivalent","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Total greenhouse gas emissions per year","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Total greenhouse gas emissions per year","target_name":"Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning","indicator_number":"13.2.2","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"UN Climate Change (UNFCCC Secretariat)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=13&Target=13.2","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals metadata for target 13.2","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"World Bank","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2004,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY?locations=GB","source_url_text_1":"Poverty headcount ratio at $1.90 a day (2011 PPP) (% of population)","source_release_date_1":"28/05/2020","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Non-official","source_contact_1":"Research@WorldBank.org","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"13.2.2","target_id":"13.2","sdg_goal":"13","indicator_sort_order":"13-02-02"}
