It provides access to a number of communication services including the World Wide Web and carries e-mail, news, entertainment and data files, irrespective of the device used (not assumed to be only via a computer - it may also be by mobile telephone, tablet, PDA, games machine, digital TV etc.).

The number of Internet users has increased substantially over the last decade and access to the Internet has changed the way people live, communicate, work and do business. Internet uptake is a key indicator tracked by policy makers and others to measure the development of the information society and the growth of Internet content \u2013 including user-generated content \u2013 provides access to increasing amounts of information and services.</p><p>Despite growth in networks, services and applications, information and communication technology (ICT) access and use is still far from equally distributed, and many people cannot yet benefit from the potential of the Internet. This indicator highlights the importance of Internet use as a development enabler and helps to measure the digital divide, which, if not properly addressed, will aggravate inequalities in all development domains. Classificatory variables for individuals using the Internet \u2013such as age, sex, education level or labour force status \u2013 can help identify digital divides in individuals using the Internet. This information can contribute to the design of targeted policies to overcome those divides.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>This data is disaggregated by regions, sex, rural and urban areas.</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-11","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-11-11: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/79f9212d823bec5ca89f2efa6288f8e41e8696eb","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Proportion of individuals using the Internet","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Proportion of individuals using the Internet","target_name":"Fully operationalize the technology bank and science, technology and innovation capacity-building mechanism for least developed countries by 2017 and enhance the use of enabling technology, in particular information and communications technology","indicator_number":"17.8.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"International Telecommunication Union (ITU)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-17-08-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 469 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_1":null,"source_earliest_available_1":2006,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www2.statsghana.gov.gh/nada/index.php/catalog#_r=1664470556419&collection=&country=&dtype=&from=1960&page=1&ps=&sid=&sk=glss&sort_by=rank&sort_order=desc&to=2015&topic=&view=s&vk=","source_url_text_1":"Ghana Living Standards Survey","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"17.8.1","target_id":"17.8","sdg_goal":"17","indicator_sort_order":"17-08-01"}
