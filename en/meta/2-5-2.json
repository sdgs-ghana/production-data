Further there are indirect links</p><p>to \u201cmalnutrition\u201d: Animal genetic resources for food and agriculture are an essential part of the</p><p>biological basis for world food security, and contribute to the livelihoods of over a thousand million</p><p>people. A diverse resource base is critical for human survival and well-being, and a contribution</p><p>to the eradication of hunger: animal genetic resources are crucial in adapting to changing socioeconomic</p><p>and environmental conditions, including climate change. They are the animal breeder\u2019s</p><p>raw material and amongst the farmer\u2019s most essential inputs. They are essential for sustainable</p><p>agricultural production.</p>","REC_USE_LIM":"<p>Breed-related information remains far from complete.
