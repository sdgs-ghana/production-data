If competent authorities are not alerted they are not in a condition to conduct proper investigations and administer justice. However, lack of trust and confidence in the ability of the police or other authorities to provide effective redress, or objective and subjective difficulties in accessing them, can influence negatively the reporting behaviour of crime victims. As such, reporting rates provide a direct measure of the confidence of victims of crime in the ability of the police or other authorities to provide assistance and bring perpetrators to justice. Reporting rates provide also a measure of the \u2018dark figure\u2019 of crime, that is the proportion of crimes not reported to the police. Trends in reporting rates of violent crime can be used to monitor public trust and confidence in competent authorities on the basis of actual behaviours and not perceptions.</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>Number of victims of violent crime in the previous 12 months who reported their victimization to competent authorities or other officially recognized conflict resolution mechanisms, divided by the number of all victims of violent crime in the previous 12 months (also called the \u2018crime reporting rate\u2019) multiplied by 100.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>This data is disaggregated by rural and urban areas.</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-11","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Proportion of victims of violence in the previous 12 months who reported their victimization to competent authorities or other officially recognized conflict resolution mechanisms","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_name":"Proportion of victims of violence in the previous 12 months who reported their victimization to competent authorities or other officially recognized conflict resolution mechanisms","target_name":"Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for all","indicator_number":"16.3.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODC))","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-16-03-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 214 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2013,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www2.statsghana.gov.gh/nada/index.php/catalog#_r=1664470556419&collection=&country=&dtype=&from=1960&page=1&ps=&sid=&sk=glss&sort_by=rank&sort_order=desc&to=2015&topic=&view=s&vk=","source_url_text_1":"Ghana Living Standards Survey","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"target_number":"16.3","goal_number":"16","indicator_sort_order":"16-03-01"}
