Drinking water may be contaminated with human or animal faeces containing pathogens or with chemical and physical contaminants, leading to harmful effects on health. While improving water quality is critical to prevent the transmission of many diseases (such as diarrhoea which exacerbates malnutrition and remains a leading global cause of child deaths), improving the accessibility and availability of drinking water is equally important for health and welfare, particularly for women and girls who often bear the primary responsibility for collecting drinking water from distant sources.  As a result, the SDG indicator 6.1.1 is designed to address safe management of drinking water services, including dimensions of accessibility, availability and quality.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>This data is disaggregated by urban and rural areas.</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241549950\">https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241549950</a></p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-06","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-11-06: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/493909d897bf5e452e58aa311e90e1d56280a537","composite_breakdown_label":"Source","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services","target_name":"By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all","indicator_number":"6.1.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"World Health Organisation (WHO), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEFF)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-06-01-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 224 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene","source_periodicity_1":"Biennial","source_earliest_available_1":2000,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"","source_url_1":"https://washdata.org/data/household#!/table?geo0=country&geo1=GHA","source_url_text_1":"WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene","source_release_date_1":"01/07/2021","source_next_release_1":"01/07/2023","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official international","source_contact_1":"info@washdata.org","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"6.1.1","target_id":"6.1","sdg_goal":"6","indicator_sort_order":"06-01-01"}
