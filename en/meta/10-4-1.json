Compensation of employees includes: (i) wages and salaries (in cash or in kind) and (ii) social insurance contributions payable by employers. This concept views compensation of employees as a cost to employer, thus compensation equals zero for unpaid work undertaken voluntarily. Moreover, it does not include taxes payable by employers on the wage and salary bill, such as payroll tax.</p><p>The indicator should be produced using data that cover all economic activities, all employees, and the self-employed.

The share of labour compensation in national output can highlight the extent to which economic growth translates into higher incomes for employees over time (and/or higher earnings for the self-employed). In periods of economic recession, the labour income share provides an indication of the extent to which falling output reduces labour income relative to profits. If labour income falls at a greater rate than profits, the labour income share will be expected to fall. By contrast, if there is a sharper decline in profits than in labour income, the share will rise. For any given level of GDP and profits, the labour</p><p>income share can fall as a result of falling wages, falling earnings of the self-employed, changes in the composition of employment by income or a combination of these.</p><p>Increased production and GDP often lead to improved living standards of individuals in the economy, but this will depend on the distribution of real income and public policy among other factors</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>Labour share of Gross Domestic Product =</p><p><em>{[(Total compensation o employees) + (Labour income of the self-employed)]/ Gross Domestic Product }* 100</em></p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://open.africa/dataset/ghana-living-standards-survey-glss-7-2017\">https://open.africa/dataset/ghana-living-standards-survey-glss-7-2017</a></p><p>https://www2.statsghana.gov.gh/docfiles/glss6/GLSS6_Labour%20Force%20Report.pdf</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-10-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-10-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/8b48184d7d6b6f550c672990684c4b8b7bf3b580","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percent","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Labour share of GDP","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Labour share of GDP","target_name":"Adopt policies, especially fiscal, wage and social protection policies, and progressively achieve greater equality","indicator_number":"10.4.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"International Labour Organization (ILO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-10-04-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 190 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"World Bank","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2004,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY?locations=GB","source_url_text_1":"Poverty headcount ratio at $1.90 a day (2011 PPP) (% of population)","source_release_date_1":"28/05/2020","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Non-official","source_contact_1":"Research@WorldBank.org","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"10.4.1","target_id":"10.4","sdg_goal":"10","indicator_sort_order":"10-04-01"}
