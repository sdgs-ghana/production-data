The severity of food insecurity, defined as a latent trait, is measured on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale global reference scale, a measurement standard established by FAO through the application of the Food Insecurity Experience Scale in more than 140 countries worldwide, starting in 2014.</p><p>Concepts:</p><p>Extensive research over more than 25 years has demonstrated that the inability to access food results in a series of experiences and conditions that are fairly common across cultures and socio-economic contexts and that range from being concerned about the ability to obtain enough food, to the need to compromise on the quality or the diversity of food consumed, to being forced to reduce the intake of food by cutting portion sizes or skipping meals, up to the extreme condition of feeling hungry and not having means to access any food for a whole day. Typical conditions like these form the basis of an experience-based food insecurity measurement scale. When analysed through sound statistical methods rooted in Item Response Theory, data collected through such scales provide the basis to compute theoretically consistent, cross country comparable measures of the prevalence of food insecurity. The severity of the food insecurity condition as measured by this indicator thus directly reflects the extent of households\u2019 or individuals\u2019 inability to regularly access the food they need.</p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Percentage</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>Computed from GLSS Round 7</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>Ghana Statistical Service</p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<p>Ghana Statistical Service</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>Food insecurity at moderate levels of severity is typically associated with the inability to regularly eat healthy, balanced diets. As such, high prevalence of food insecurity at moderate levels can be considered a predictor of various forms of diet-related health conditions in the population, associated with micronutrient deficiency and unbalanced diets. Severe levels of food insecurity, on the other hand, imply a high probability of reduced food intake and therefore can lead to more severe forms of undernutrition, including hunger.</p><p>Short questionnaires like the FIES are very easy to administer at limited cost, which is one of the main advantages of their use. The ability to precisely determine the food insecurity status of specific individuals or households, however, is limited by the small number of questions, a reason why assignment of individual respondents to food insecurity classes is best done in probability terms, thus ensuring that estimates of prevalence rates in a population are sufficiently reliable even when based on relatively small sample sizes.</p><p>As with any statistical assessment, reliability and precision crucially depend on the quality of the survey design and implementation. One major advantage of the analytic treatment of the data through the Rasch model-based methods is that it permits testing the quality of the data collected and evaluating the likely margin of uncertainty around estimated prevalence rates, which should always be reported.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>The data has been disaggregated in regions, rural and urban areas</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/\">SDG Indicators \u2014 SDG Indicators (un.org)</a></p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-10-20","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-10-20: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/786eac1a3cc3c27e2d81327a8ed3fad3b5ce1df4","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percent","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":true,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":["URBANISATION"],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in the population, based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES)","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_name":"Prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in the population, based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES)","target_name":"By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round","indicator_number":"2.1.2","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-02-01-02.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 426 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ghana Statistical Service","source_periodicity_1":null,"source_earliest_available_1":2017,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www2.statsghana.gov.gh/nada/index.php/catalog#_r=1664470556419&collection=&country=&dtype=&from=1960&page=1&ps=&sid=&sk=glss&sort_by=rank&sort_order=desc&to=2015&topic=&view=s&vk=","source_url_text_1":"Ghana Living Standard Survey","source_release_date_1":"02/10/2018","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"2.1.2","target_id":"2.1","sdg_goal":"2","indicator_sort_order":"02-01-02"}
