Unpaid domestic and care work refers to activities related to the provision of services for own final use by household members, or by family members living in other households. These activities are listed in <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/timeuse/23012019%20ICATUS.pdf\">ICATUS 2016</a> under the major divisions \u201c3.

In addition, it also provides an assessment of gender equality, by highlighting discrepancies between how much time women and men spend on unpaid work, like cooking, cleaning or taking care of children. This indicator measures the average amount of time as a proportion in a day, so that if it is reported that women aged 15+ spend 10% of their day on unpaid domestic chores while men in the same age group spend 1%, it indicates that women spend 2.4 hours (2 hours and 24 minutes), while men spend 14.4 minutes on it a day, on average. </p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>Time spent in unpaid care and domestic work divided by total time, multiplied by 100 (disaggregated by sex).</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>This data is disaggregated  by sex, urban and rural areas.</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p> <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/docs/sna2008.pdf\">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/docs/sna2008.pdf</a> </p><p><a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---stat/documents/publication/wcms_220535.pdf\">https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---stat/documents/publication/wcms_220535.pdf</a></p><p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/timeuse/23012019%20ICATUS.pdf\">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/timeuse/23012019%20ICATUS.pdf</a></p><p><a href=\"https://ilostat.ilo.org/about/standards/icls/icls-documents/#:~:text=19th%20ICLS%20%2D%202%20to%2011,the%20functioning%20of%20the%20Conference\">https://ilostat.ilo.org/about/standards/icls/icls-documents/#:~:text=19th%20ICLS%20%2D%202%20to%2011,the%20functioning%20of%20the%20Conference</a></p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-09","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-11-09: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/cd384aaeeb8a725660ab5e11fee2a97e1c8b79e5","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Minute(s)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":["SEX","AGE","URBANISATION"],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work, by sex, age and location","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_name":"Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work, by sex, age and location","target_name":"Recognize and value unpaid care and domestic work through the provision of public services, infrastructure and social protection policies and the promotion of shared responsibility within the household and the family as nationally appropriate","indicator_number":"5.4.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"UN Statistics Division (UNSD)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-05-04-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 337 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_1":"","source_earliest_available_1":2013,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www.statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/fileUpload/Living%20conditions/GLSS6_Main%20Report.pdf","source_url_text_1":"Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS), 2014","source_release_date_1":"August, 2014","source_next_release_1":"","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"5.4.1","target_id":"5.4","sdg_goal":"5","indicator_sort_order":"05-04-01"}
