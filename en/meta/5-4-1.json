In addition, it also provides an assessment of gender equality, by highlighting discrepancies between how much time women and men spend on unpaid work, like cooking, cleaning or taking care of children. This indicator measures the average amount of time as a proportion in a day, so that if for a given country it is reported that women aged 15+ spend 10% of their day on unpaid domestic chores while men in the same age group spend 1%, it indicates that women spend 2.4 hours (2 hours and 24 minutes), while men spend 14.4 minutes on it a day, on average. </p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-11-15","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-11-15: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/cf6256623211021208af2aae2efb8cc457e226da","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":["SEX","AGE","URBANISATION"],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work, by sex, age and location","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work, by sex, age and location","indicator_number":"5.4.1","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"indicator":"5.4.1","target_id":"5.4","sdg_goal":"5","indicator_sort_order":"05-04-01"}
