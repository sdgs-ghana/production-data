Wasting can however also be assessed with mid upper arm circumference (MUAC). Estimates of wasting based on  MUAC are not considered for the joint dataset.  In addition, while wasting constitutes the major form of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM), there are acutely malnourished children who would not be picked up with weight-for-height or MUAC, namely those presenting bilateral pitting  odema (characterized by swollen feet, face and limbs).  For Surveys that report oedema cases, in the joint data set these are included in the prevalence of low weight-for-height. </p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>2011 and 2018 Ghana MICs; GDHS 20145; and projection (2015)</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>Child growth is an internationally accepted outcome reflecting child nutritional status. Child wasting refers to a child who is too thin for his or her height and is the result of recent rapid weight loss or the failure to gain weight. A child who is moderately or severely wasted has an increased risk of death, but treatment is possible. Child wasting is one of the World Health Assembly nutrition target indicators.</p>","REC_USE_LIM":"<p>Survey estimates come with levels of uncertainty due to both sampling error and non-sampling error (e.g. mesasurement technical error, recording error etc.,). None of the two sources of errros have been fully taken into account for deriving estimates neither at country nor at regional and global levels.   Surveys are carried out in a specific period of the year, usually over a few months. However, this indicator can be affected by seasonality, factors related to food availability (e.g. pre-harvest periods), disease (e.g. rainy season and diarrhoea, malaria, etc.), and  natural disasters and conflicts. Hence, country-year estimates may not necessarily be comparable over time. Consequently, only latest estimates are provided. </p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-10-29","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-10-29: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/e14f7088f4434120b5a95af7badd34439201e8ba","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Prevalence of malnutrition (weight for height >+2 or <-2 standard deviation from the median of the WHO Child Growth Standards) among children under 5 years of age, by type (wasting and overweight)","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Prevalence of malnutrition (weight for height >+2 or <-2 standard deviation from the median of the WHO Child Growth Standards) among children under 5 years of age, by type (wasting and overweight)","indicator_number":"2.2.2","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"indicator":"2.2.2","target_id":"2.2","sdg_goal":"2","indicator_sort_order":"02-02-02"}
