It measures the results of policies that aim to strengthen tenure<br/>security for all, including women and other vulnerable groups.<br/>Indicator 1.4.2 covers (a) all types of land use (such as residential, commercial, agricultural, forestry, grazing,<br/>wetlands based on standard land-use classification) in both rural and urban areas; and (b) all land tenure<br/>types as recognized at the country level, such as freehold, leasehold, public land, customary land. An<br/>individual can hold land in his/her own name, jointly with other individuals, as a member of a household,<br/>or collectively as member of group1, cooperative or other type of association.<br/>Secure tenure rights: comprised of two sub-components: (i) legally recognized documentation and (ii)<br/>perception of the security of tenure, which are both necessary to provide a full measurement of tenure<br/>security.<br/>Legally recognized documentation: Legal documentation of rights refers to the recording and publication<br/>of information on the nature and location of land, rights and right holders in a form that is recognized by<br/>government, and is therefore official. For purposes of computing SDG Indicator 1.4.2, the country<br/>specific metadata will define what documentation on land rights will be counted as legally recognized<br/>(see next section for rationale).<br/>Perceived security of tenure: Perception of tenure security refers to an individual\u2019s perception of the<br/>likelihood of involuntary loss of land, such as disagreement of the ownership rights over land or ability to<br/>use it, regardless of the formal status and can be more optimistic or pessimistic. Although those without<br/>land rights\u2019 documentation may frequently be perceived to be under threat, and those with<br/>documentation perceived as protected, there may be situations where documented land rights alone are<br/>insufficient to guarantee tenure security. Conversely, even without legally recognized documentation,<br/>individuals may feel themselves to be protected against eviction or dispossession. Therefore, capturing<br/>and analysing these diverse ranges of situations will enable a more comprehensive understanding of land<br/>tenure security, based on a country specific context.<br/>For purposes of constructing the indicator (see next section for rationale), we define perceptions of<br/>tenure to be secure if:<br/>(i) The landholder does not report a fear of involuntary loss of the land within the next five years<br/>due to, for example, intra-family, community or external threats and<br/>(ii) The landholder reports having the right to bequeath the land.<br/>Total adult population: A country\u2019s adult population2 is measured by census data or through surveys using<br/>an adequate sampling frame.<br/>Interpretation:<br/>One motivation that makes the indicator actionable is that, in many developing countries, the gap between<br/>data on the availability of documentation and on perception of tenure security can be large. For example,<br/>tenure may be perceived as secure, even though rights are not formally documented, as in the case of<br/>customary systems and trusted local land governance arrangements. Or, the opposite, tenure may be<br/>perceived as insecure even when there is a high level of formal documentation of rights. The latter situation<br/>can be caused by various factors, including limited trust in land administration services, possible duplicated<br/>documents, high cost of having state institutions protecting such rights.<br/>Reporting on perceived security will provide important information on people\u2019s satisfaction with the<br/>institutional quality of service, transparency, appropriateness, accessibility and affordability of land<br/>administration services and justice systems.</p><p>specific and refers to categories of tenure rights, for<br/>example customary, leasehold, public and freehold. Rights can be held collectively, jointly or individually<br/>and may cover one or more elements of the bundle of rights (the right of possession, of control, of<br/>exclusion, of enjoyment and of disposition).<br/>Land governance: Rules, processes and structures through which decisions are made regarding access to<br/>and the use (and transfer) of land, how those decisions are implemented and the way that Concepts:<br/>The concepts below are based on the \u201cVoluntary Guidelines for the Responsible Governance of Tenure of<br/>Land, Forests and Fisheries in the Context of National Food Security\u201d (shorthand VGGT), which were<br/>endorsed by the United Nations World Committee on World Food Security in 2012 and therefore<br/>considered an internationally accepted standard. Other international frameworks using these concepts<br/>are the African Union Agenda on Land as laid out in the 2009 Framework and Guidelines on Land Policy in<br/>Africa and the 2014 Nairobi Action Plan on Large-Scale Land-Based Investments.<br/>Tenure: How people, communities and others gain access to land and natural resources (including<br/>fisheries and forests) is defined and regulated by societies through systems of tenure. These tenure<br/>systems determine who can use which resources, for how long, and under what conditions. Tenure<br/>systems may be based on written policies and laws, as well as on unwritten customs and practices. No<br/>tenure right, including private ownership, is absolute. All tenure rights are limited by the rights of others<br/>and by the measures taken by states for public purposes (VGGT, 2012).<br/>Tenure typology: A tenure typology is country conflicting<br/>interests in land are managed.

Many tenure problems also arise because of weak land governance, disputes due to land acquisition or large-scale land-</p><p>based investments, and attempts to address tenure problems associated with dualisms to tenure regimes. Responsible governance of tenure of land is inextricably linked with access to and management of other natural resources, such as forests, water, fisheries and mineral resources. The governance of tenure is a crucial element in determining if and how people, communities and others acquire rights, and their associated obligations, to use and control land and natural resources. Legal recognition to group tenure or adopting a \u2018fit for purpose\u2019 land administration and using these to recognize outer boundaries of land held under communal or customary arrangements have increasingly received government attention in the recent past.</p><p>Increasing demand for pro-poor land reforms has created the need for a core set of land indicators that have national application and global comparability, and culminated in SDG 1.4.25. Regular reporting on indicator 1.4.2 will provide an impetus to improve the availability of data from surveys as well as regularity of reporting on land administration service delivery to people by registries and other line agencies. Indicator 1.4.2 thus measures gender disaggregated progress in tenure security.</p><p>All forms of tenure should provide people with a degree of tenure security, with states protecting legitimate tenure rights, ensuring that people are not arbitrarily evicted and that their legitimate tenure rights are not otherwise extinguished or infringed. Perceptions of tenure security matter because they influence the way that land is used. Sources of perceived insecurity may include contestation from within households, families, communities or as a result of the actions of governments or private land claimants. Secure tenure rights for women require particular attention and could be affected by a number of factors, including intra-household power relations, community level inequalities, or different tenure regimes, and which can be cross tabulated against other factors of difference to ensure that women are no left behind. If measured at the individual level, the right to bequeath is another proxy of perception of tenure security. Women\u2019s ability to influence intergenerational land transfers is an important aspect of female empowerment (and one way in which this indicator links with indicator 5.a.1).</p><p>\u201cLegally recognized documentation\u201d and \u201cperception of tenure security\u201d are two complementary parts of this indicator and which reflects several insights, namely (i) land is a key asset that is essential for poverty reduction, human rights and equality of opportunity including by gender; (ii) secure land tenure creates incentives for investment in land, allows land to be transferred, and creates the institutional precondition for use of land as collateral to access finance for economic activity; (iii) there is a need to complement formal measures of tenure security with perception-based measures.</p><p>This indicator will inform policy and allow for the assessment of specific outcomes and practical priorities for further improvements of tenure security at the country level.
