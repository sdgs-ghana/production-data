As a consequence,<br/>although the flow of wastewater generated can be disaggregated by sources (domestic, services and industrial), the treated wastewater statistics are most commonly disaggregated by type (e.g. urban and industrial) and/or level of treatment (e.g. secondary) rather than by sources.<br/><br/>Domestic wastewater: Wastewater from residential settlements which originates predominantly from the human metabolism and from household activities.<br/></p><p>Industrial (process) wastewater: Water discharged after being used in, or produced by, industrial production processes and which is of no further immediate value to these processes. <br/></p><p>Total wastewater generated is the total volume of wastewater generated by economic activities (agriculture, forestry and fishing; mining and quarrying; manufacturing; electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply; and other economic activities) and households. <br/></p><p>Urban wastewater: Domestic wastewater or the mixture of domestic wastewater with industrial wastewater and/or runoff rainwater.<br/></p><p>Wastewater: Wastewater is water which is of no further value to the purpose for which it was used because of its quality, quantity or time of occurrence.
