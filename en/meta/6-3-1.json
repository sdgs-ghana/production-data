Both of Last updated: 2020-09-14<br/>these indicators are measured in units of 1000 m3/day, although some data sources may use other units<br/>that require conversion. The ratio of the volume treated to the volume generated is taken as the<br/>\u2018proportion of wastewater flow safely treated\u2019.<br/>Wastewater flows will be classified into industrial, services, and domestic flows, with reference to the<br/>International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities Revision 4 (ISIC). To the extent<br/>possible, the proportion of each of these waste streams that is safely treated before discharge to the<br/>environment will be calculated.<br/>Concepts:<br/>Total wastewater generation and treatment can be quantified at the national level, and wastewater can<br/>also be disaggregated into different types of flows, based on ISIC categories. Domestic wastewater<br/>generated by private households, as well as wastewater generated by economic activities covered by ISIC<br/>categories, may or may not be pre-treated on premises before discharge to either the sewer for further<br/>treatment or directly to the environment. The main sources of wastewater include wastewater from households, services and industries, i.e. point<br/>sources of one or more pollutant(s) that can be geographically located and represented as a point on a<br/>map. Diffused pollution from non-point sources such as runoff from urban and agricultural land can<br/>contribute quite significantly to wastewater flows (Figure 1), and therefore its progressive inclusion in the<br/>global monitoring framework will be important. Presently, it cannot be monitored at source and its<br/>impact on ambient water quality will be monitored under indicator 6.3.2 \u201cProportion of bodies of water<br/>with good ambient water quality\u201d.<br/>Differentiating between the different wastewater streams is important as policy decisions need to be<br/>guided by the polluter pays principle. However, wastewater conveyed by combined sewers usually<br/>combines both hazardous and non-hazardous substances discharged from different sources, but also<br/>runoff and urban stormwater, which cannot be separately tracked and monitored. As a consequence,<br/>although the flow of wastewater generated can be disaggregated by sources (domestic, services</p><p>industrial), the treated wastewater statistics are most commonly disaggregated by type (e.g. urban and<br/>industrial) and/or level of treatment (e.g. secondary) rather than by sources.<br/>Total wastewater flows can be classified into three main categories (see \u2018disaggregation section\u2019 for<br/>details:<br/>\u2022 Industrial (ISIC divisions 05-35)<br/>\u2022 Services (ISIC divisions 45-96)<br/>\u2022 Domestic (private households)<br/>Wastewater treatment can be classified into three main categories (see \u2018disaggregation section\u2019 for<br/>details:<br/>\u2022 Primary<br/>\u2022 Secondary<br/>\u2022 Tertiary<br/>Where possible, treatment will additionally be classified into either on-premises or off-premises<br/>treatment.<br/>Domestic wastewater: Wastewater from residential settlements which originates predominantly from<br/>the human metabolism and from household activities.<br/>Industrial (process) wastewater: Water discharged after being used in, or produced by, industrial<br/>production processes and which is of no further immediate value to these processes. Where process<br/>water recycling systems have been installed, process wastewater is the final discharge from these<br/>circuits.
