It is an inverse proxy of the efficiency with which an economy is able to use energy to produce economic output. A lower ratio indicates that less energy is used to produce one unit of output, so decreasing<br/>trends indicate progress.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>There is no available disaggregation for this indicator.</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/factbook-2015-40-en.pdf?expires=1668089302&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=BAF5608EB8D3901C7B1C8FF514D596DB\">https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/factbook-2015-40-en.pdf?expires=1668089302&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=BAF5608EB8D3901C7B1C8FF514D596DB</a> </p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-10-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-10-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/8b48184d7d6b6f550c672990684c4b8b7bf3b580","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"TOE/million US$","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP","target_name":"By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency","indicator_number":"7.3.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"International Energy Agency (IEA) and United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD).","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-07-03-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 192 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Energy Commission","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"http://www.energycom.gov.gh/planning/energy-statistics","source_url_text_1":"National Energy Statistics","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"statistics@energycom.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"7.3.1","target_id":"7.3","sdg_goal":"7","indicator_sort_order":"07-03-01"}
