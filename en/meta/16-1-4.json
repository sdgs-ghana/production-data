Nevertheless, the \u2018fear of crime\u2019 is an important indicator in itself as a high level of fear can negatively influence well-being and lead to reduced contacts with the public, reduced trust and activities and thus an obstacle to development.</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>(Number of respondents who feel very safe or safe walking alone after dark in their neighbourhood/Total number of survey respondents)*100 </p>","COVERAGE":"<p>This data is disaggregated by sex, rural and urban areas.</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-16-01-04.pdf\">https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-16-01-04.pdf</a> </p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-11","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Proportion of population that feel safe walking alone around the area they live","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_name":"Proportion of population that feel safe walking alone around the area they live","target_name":"Significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere","indicator_number":"16.1.4","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-16-01-04.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 213 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2013,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www2.statsghana.gov.gh/nada/index.php/catalog#_r=1664470556419&collection=&country=&dtype=&from=1960&page=1&ps=&sid=&sk=glss&sort_by=rank&sort_order=desc&to=2015&topic=&view=s&vk=","source_url_text_1":"Ghana Living Standards Survey","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"target_number":"16.1","goal_number":"16","indicator_sort_order":"16-01-04"}
