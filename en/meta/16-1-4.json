It is important to understand that \u2018fear of crime\u2019 is a phenomenon that is separate from the prevalence of crime and that may be even largely independent from actual experience, as the perception of crime and the resulting fear of it is mediated by a number of factors, such as the awareness of crime, the public discussion and the media and personal circumstances. Nevertheless, the \u2018fear of crime\u2019 is an important indicator in itself as a high level of fear can negatively influence well-being and lead to reduced contacts with the public, reduced trust and activities and thus an obstacle to development.</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-10-29","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-10-29: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/736e477571729aa8231126262a96bc7ab9d684a8","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Proportion of population that feel safe walking alone around the area they live","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Proportion of population that feel safe walking alone around the area they live","indicator_number":"16.1.4","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"indicator":"16.1.4","target_id":"16.1","sdg_goal":"16","indicator_sort_order":"16-01-04"}
