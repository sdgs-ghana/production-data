Specifically, Indicator 7.1.1 refers to the proportion of population with access to electricity. This is expressed in percentage figures and is disaggregated by total, urban and rural access rates per country, as well as by UN regional and global classifications. </p><p>Concepts:</p><p>Electricity access in this scenario refers to the proportion of population in the considered area (country, region or global context) that has access to consistent sources of electricity. </p><p>The World Bank\u2019s Global Electrification Database compiles nationally representative household survey data as well as census data from 1990 to 2019. It also incorporates data from the Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa Poverty Database, and the Europe and Central Asia Poverty Database, all of which are based on similar surveys. At the time of this analysis, the Global Electrification Database contained 1,282 surveys from 139 countries, excluding surveys from high-income countries as classified by the United. </p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Percentage (%)</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS) Round 6, 2014; Round, 7, 2019 </p><p>PBB, MoE,2019</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)</p><p>Ministry of Energy (MoE)</p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<p>Ghana Statistical service</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>Access to electricity addresses major critical issues in all the dimensions of sustainable development. The target has a wide range of social and economic impacts, including facilitating development of income generating activities and lightening the burden of household tasks. Under the global target of equal access to energy, SDG7.1.1 focuses specifically on electricity access available to the global population. In order to gain a clear picture, access rates are only considered if the primary source of lighting is the local electricity provider, solar systems, mini-grids and stand-alone systems. Sources such as generators, candles, batteries, etc., are not considered due to their limited working capacities and since they are usually kept as backup sources for lighting.</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>Total Population with access divided by the total national population multiplied by 100 = National Access Rate</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-10-12","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-10-12: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/12b9f683d91bb44bc95617bb326f4116602e5e35","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percent","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":["URBANISATION"],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Proportion of population with access to electricity","graph_titles":[{"series":"Proportion of household with access to electricity [7.1.1]","title":"Proportion of household with access to electricity [7.1.1]"}],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Proportion of population with access to electricity","target_name":"By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services","indicator_number":"7.1.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"World Bank (WB)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-07-01-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 212 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Energy Commission","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"http://www.energycom.gov.gh/planning/energy-statistics","source_url_text_1":"National Energy Statistics","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"statistics@energycom.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"7.1.1","target_id":"7.1","sdg_goal":"7","indicator_sort_order":"07-01-01"}
