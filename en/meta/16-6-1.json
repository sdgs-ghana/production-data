Scoring is at the heart of the indicator. A country is scored separately on a four point ordinal scale (A, B, C, or D), according to precise criteria (A) Aggregate expenditure outturn was between (95%) and (105%) of the approved aggregate budgeted expenditure in at least two of the last three years. (B) Aggregate expenditure outturn was between (90%) and (110%) of the approved aggregate budgeted expenditure in at least two of the last three years. (C Aggregate expenditure outturn was between (85%) and (115%) of the approved aggregate budgeted expenditure in at least two of the last three years. (D) Performance is less than required for a C score</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-06-16","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-06-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/6eaec674bdcfd8d0adfe0486b5d7a930b8d2bf43","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Primary government expenditures as a proportion of original approved budget, by sector (or by budget codes or similar)","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Primary government expenditures as a proportion of original approved budget, by sector (or by budget codes or similar)","indicator_number":"16.6.1","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"indicator":"16.6.1","target_id":"16.6","sdg_goal":"16","indicator_sort_order":"16-06-01"}
