They accounted for 93%</p><p>of the total GHG emissions of which transport and electricity generation were the main sources.</p><p>Between 1990 and 2012, CO2 emissions rose by 79.3%; 2.6 Mt in 1990 to 12.59 Mt in 2012. The</p><p>increases in CO2 emissions were mainly due to the increasing emissions contributions from the</p><p>transport and energy industries categories. The rise in the CO2 emissions could be seen as a result</p><p>of the following factors (a) increasing traffic congestion in the urban centres (b) increasing thermal</p><p>electricity in the generation mix (c) increasing use of stand-by generators in commercial activities</p><p>during load shedding periods, by the utility companies and (d) kerosene use in both domestic</p><p>(non-electrified rural areas) and commercial (part of urban centers) lighting. Increases in CO2</p><p>emissions has adverse effects on the environment and health and so monitoring the indicator</p><p>will help achieve the Target 3.9 by 2030, which is, substantially reduce the number of deaths and</p><p>illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination.</p>","REC_USE_LIM":"<p>The process of estimating GHG emissions has inherent uncertainties.
