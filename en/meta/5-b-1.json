However, not every person uses, or owns a mobile-cellular telephone. Mobile phone ownership, in particular, is important to track gender equality since the mobile phone is a personal device that, if owned and not just shared, provides women with a degree of independence and autonomy, including for professional purposes. A number of studies have highlighted the link between mobile phone ownership and empowerment, and productivity growth. Existing data on the proportion of women owning a mobile phone suggest that less women than men own a mobile phone. This indicator highlights the importance of mobile phone ownership to track and to improve gender equality, and monitoring will help design targeted policies to overcome the gender divide. </p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-09","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-11-09: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/7ab60e7d6779080bdb6598f3f7c6a6abab009060","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":["SEX"],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Proportion of individuals who own a mobile telephone, by sex","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_name":"Proportion of individuals who own a mobile telephone, by sex","target_name":"Enhance the use of enabling technology, in particular information and communications technology, to promote the empowerment of women","indicator_number":"5.b.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"International Telecommunication Union (ITU)","goal_meta_link":"unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-05-0B-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 211 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_1":"","source_earliest_available_1":2017,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www.statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/fileUpload/pressrelease/GLSS7%20MAIN%20REPORT_FINAL.pdf","source_url_text_1":"Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS)","source_release_date_1":"June, 2019","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"5.b.1","target_id":"5.b","sdg_goal":"5","indicator_sort_order":"05-0b-01"}
