A low completion rate indicates low or delayed entry into a given level of education, high drop-out, high repetition, late completion, or a combination of these factors.</p><p>The completion rate can be used either as a self-standing indicator or in combination with SDG indicator 4.1.1 (proportion of children and young people (a) in Grade 2 or 3; (b) at the end of primary education; and (c) at the end of lower secondary education achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics). Combining the completion rate with indicator 4.1.1 provides information on the percentage of children or young people in a cohort who achieve a minimum level of proficiency, and not only on the percentage of children in school who achieve minimum proficiency.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>The data has been disaggregated into educational levels</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-04-01-02.pdf\">SDG Indicators \u2014 SDG Indicators (un.org)</a></p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-14","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Completion rate (primary education, lower secondary education, upper secondary education)","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Completion rate (primary education, lower secondary education, upper secondary education)","target_name":"By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes","indicator_number":"4.1.2","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"UNESCO Institute for Statistics","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=4&Target=4.1","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata 4.1.2","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Education (MoE)","source_periodicity_1":"","source_earliest_available_1":"","source_geographical_coverage_1":"","source_url_1":"https://moe.gov.gh/emis/","source_url_text_1":"EMIS Data Centre, Ministry of Education (MoE)","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"pro@moe.gov.gh","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Ministry of Education (MoE)","source_periodicity_2":"","source_earliest_available_2":"","source_geographical_coverage_2":"","source_url_2":"https://www.globalpartnership.org/sites/default/files/2019-05-education-sector-medium-term-development-plan_2018-2021.pdf","source_url_text_2":"Education sector Medium-Term development Plan 2018\u20132021","source_release_date_2":"","source_next_release_2":"","source_statistical_classification_2":"Official","source_contact_2":"pro@moe.gov.gh","source_active_3":true,"source_organisation_3":"National Development Planning Commission (NDPC)","source_periodicity_3":"","source_earliest_available_3":"","source_geographical_coverage_3":"","source_url_3":"https://ndpc.gov.gh/media/2020_SDGs_Report-Final.pdf","source_url_text_3":"Ghana\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Report, 2020","source_release_date_3":"","source_next_release_3":"","source_statistical_classification_3":"Official","source_contact_3":"info@ndpc.gov.gh","source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"target_number":"4.1","goal_number":"4","indicator_sort_order":"04-01-02"}
