The indicator refers to the theoretical ability of subscribers to use non-broadband speed mobile data services, rather than the number of active users of such services.</p><p>- 3G population coverage: refers to the percentage of inhabitants that are within range of at least a 3G mobile-cellular signal, irrespective of whether or not they are subscribers. </p><p>- LTE population coverage: Refers to the percentage of inhabitants that live within range of LTE/LTE-Advanced, mobile WiMAX/WirelessMAN or other more advanced mobile-cellular networks, irrespective of whether or not they are subscribers.</p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Percentage (%)</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>National Communication Authority (NCA), 2022</p><p>Ghana\u2019s Voluntary National Review Report (VNR), 2022</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>National Communication Authority (NCA)</p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<p>National Development Planning Committee (NDPC)</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>The percentage of the population covered by a mobile cellular network can be considered as a minimum indicator for ICT access since it provides people with the possibility to subscribe to and use mobile-cellular services to communicate. Mobile networks are therefore essential to overcoming infrastructure barriers, helping people join the information society and benefit from the potential of ICTs, in particular in least developed countries.The indicator highlights the importance of mobile networks in providing basic, as well as advanced communication services and will help design targeted policies to overcome remaining infrastructure barriers, and address the digital divide. </p>","COVERAGE":"<p>There is no available disaggregation for this indicator.</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-09-0C-01.pdf\">SDG Indicators \u2014 SDG Indicators (un.org)</a></p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-14","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Proportion of population covered by a mobile network, by technology","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Proportion of population covered by a mobile network, by technology","target_name":"Significantly increase access to information and communications technology and strive to provide universal and affordable access to the Internet in least developed countries by 2020","indicator_number":"9.c.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"International Telecommunication Union (ITU)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-09-0C-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 214 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"National Communication Authority (NCA)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2017,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"","source_url_text_1":"","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@nca.org.gh","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"National Development Planning Commission (NDPC)","source_periodicity_2":"","source_earliest_available_2":"","source_geographical_coverage_2":"Ghana","source_url_2":"https://ndpc.gov.gh/media/VNR_2022_Report_c5cXm4Q.pdf","source_url_text_2":"Ghana\u2019s Voluntary National Review, 2022","source_release_date_2":"","source_next_release_2":"","source_statistical_classification_2":"Official","source_contact_2":"info@ndpc.gov.gh","source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"target_number":"9.c","goal_number":"9","indicator_sort_order":"09-0c-01"}
