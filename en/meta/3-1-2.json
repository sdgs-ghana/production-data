Not having access to this key assistance is detrimental to women's and newborns health because it could cause the death of the\u00a0women and/or the newborn\u00a0or\u00a0long lasting\u00a0morbidity. Achieving universal coverage for this indicator is therefore essential for reducing maternal and newborn mortality. </p>","REC_USE_LIM":"<p>Births attended by skilled health personnel is an indicator of health care utilization. It is a measure of the health system\u2019s functioning and potential to provide adequate coverage for childbirth. On its own, however, this indicator does not provide insight into the availability or accessibility of services, for example in cases where emergency care is needed. Neither does this indicator capture the quality of care received.</p><p>Data collection and data interpretation is challenged by lack of guidelines, standardization of professional titles and functions of the health care provider, and in some countries by task-shifting. In addition, many countries have found that there are large gaps between international standards and the competencies of existing health care professionals providing childbirth care. Lack of training and an enabling environment often hinder evidence based management of common obstetric and neonatal complications.</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>Total number of live births in the preceding five years assisted by a doctor, midwife, nurse or community health nurse (skilled health provider) divided by total number of live births in the preceding five years and multiplied by 100.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>This data is  disaggregated by regions.</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Funstats.un.org%2Fsdgs%2Fmetadata%2Ffiles%2FMetadata-03-01-02.docx&amp;wdOrigin=BROWSELINK\">Metadata-03-01-02.docx (live.com)</a></p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-07-20","composite_breakdown_label":"Type of Care","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":true,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_name":"Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel","target_name":"By 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births","indicator_number":"3.1.2","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-03-01-02.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 374 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2017,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www2.statsghana.gov.gh/docfiles/PR95.pdf","source_url_text_1":"Ghana Maternal Health Survey, 2017","source_release_date_1":"February 2018","source_next_release_1":"","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"target_number":"3.1","goal_number":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-01-02"}
