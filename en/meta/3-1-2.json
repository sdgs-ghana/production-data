{"SDG_INDICATOR_INFO":"<p>This indicator measures the proportion of deliveries attended by health personnel trained in providing lifesaving obstetric care, including giving the necessary supervision, care and advice to women during pregnancy, labour and the post-partum period, conducting deliveries on their own, and caring for newborns.

A stillbirth is a baby born after 24 or more weeks completed gestation and which did not, at any time, breathe or show signs of life.</p>","SDG_GOAL":"<h1><a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment-ghana.github.io/good-health-and-well-being\">Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. </a></h1>","SDG_TARGET":"<p>Target\u00a03.1:\u00a0By 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births.\u00a0</p>","SDG_INDICATOR":"<h2>Indicator 3.1.2: Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel</h2>","SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS":"<p>Related to Target 3.1 on reducing maternal mortality, 3.2 on reducing neonatal mortality and 3.8 on achieving universal health coverage (coverage of essential health services).</p>","SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES":"<p>United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF)\u00a0and World Health Organization (WHO)\u00a0</p>","CONTACT_ORGANISATION":"<p>Ghana Statistical Service</p>","STAT_CONC_DEF":"<p>Delivery assistance for all live births in the preceding five years by a doctor, midwife, nurse or community health nurse.

Neither does this indicator capture the quality of care received.</p><p>Data collection and data interpretation in many countries is challenged by lack of guidelines, standardization of professional titles and functions of the health care provider, and in some countries by task-shifting. In addition, many countries have found that there are large gaps between international standards and the competencies of existing of health care professionals providing childbirth care.
