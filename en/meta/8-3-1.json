Informal employment comprises persons who in their main or secondary jobs were in one of the following categories:</p><p>- Own-account workers, employers and members of producers\u2019 cooperatives employed in their own informal sector enterprises (the characteristics of the enterprise determine the informal nature of their jobs); </p><p>- Own-account workers engaged in the production of goods exclusively for own final use by their household (e.g. subsistence farming);</p><p> - Contributing family workers, regardless of whether they work in formal or informal sector enterprises (they usually do not have explicit, written contracts of employment, and are not subject to labour legislation, social security regulations, collective agreements, etc., which determines the informal nature of their jobs);</p><p> - Employees holding informal jobs, whether employed by formal sector enterprises, informal sector enterprises, or as paid domestic workers by households (employees are considered to have informal jobs if their employment relationship is, in law or in practice, not subject to national labour legislation, income taxation, social protection or entitlement to certain employment benefits). For the purpose of classifying persons into formal or informal employment for this indicator, only the characteristics of the main job are considered.</p><p> An enterprise belongs to the informal sector if it fulfills the three following conditions:</p><p> - It is an unincorporated enterprise (it is not constituted as a legal entity separate from its owners, and it is owned and controlled by one or more members of one or more households, and it is not a quasi corporation: it does not have a complete set of accounts, including balance sheets); </p><p>- It is a market enterprise (it sells at least some of the goods or services it produces);</p><p> - The enterprise is not registered or the employees of the enterprise are not registered or the number of persons engaged on a continuous basis is below a threshold determined by the country</p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Percent (%)</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>Ghana 2022 VNR</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>Ghana Statistical Service </p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<p>Ghana statistical service</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>In contexts where social protection coverage is limited, social security benefits (such as unemployment insurance) are insufficient or even in-existent, and/or where wages and pensions are low, individuals may have to take up informal employment to ensure their livelihood. In these situations, indicators such as the unemployment rate would provide a very incomplete picture of the labour market situation, overlooking major deficits in the quality of employment. Statistics on informality are key to assessing the quality of employment in an economy and are relevant to developing and developed countries alike (ILOSTAT indicator description for informality, available at https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-anddefinitions/description-informality/).</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-10-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-10-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/8b48184d7d6b6f550c672990684c4b8b7bf3b580","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percent","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Proportion of informal employment in total employment, by sector and sex","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Proportion of informal employment in total employment, by sector and sex","target_name":"Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services","indicator_number":"8.3.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"International Labour Organization (ILO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-08-03-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 191 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"World Bank","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2004,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY?locations=GB","source_url_text_1":"Poverty headcount ratio at $1.90 a day (2011 PPP) (% of population)","source_release_date_1":"28/05/2020","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Non-official","source_contact_1":"Research@WorldBank.org","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"8.3.1","target_id":"8.3","sdg_goal":"8","indicator_sort_order":"08-03-01"}
