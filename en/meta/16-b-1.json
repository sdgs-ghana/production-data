Harassment is a form of discrimination when it is also based on prohibited grounds of discrimination. Harassment may take the form of words, gestures or actions, which tend to annoy, alarm, abuse, demean, intimidate, belittle, humiliate or embarrass another or which create an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment. While generally involving a pattern of behaviours, harassment can take the form of a single incident.</p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Percentage (%)</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS) Round  7, 2017</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>The pledge to leave no-one behind and eliminate discrimination is at the centre of the <a href=\"https://www.unssc.org/sites/default/files/2030_agenda_for_sustainable_development_kcsd_primer_en.pdf\">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a>.
