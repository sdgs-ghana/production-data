International human rights law refers to the body of international legal instruments aiming to promote and protect human rights, including the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights\">Universal Declaration of Human Rights </a>and subsequent international human rights treaties adopted by the United Nations.</p><p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p><p>Discrimination is any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference or other differential treatment that is directly or indirectly based on prohibited grounds of discrimination, and which has the intention or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.  Harassment is a form of discrimination when it is also based on prohibited grounds of discrimination. Harassment may take the form of words, gestures or actions, which tend to annoy, alarm, abuse, demean, intimidate, belittle, humiliate or embarrass another or which create an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment. While generally involving a pattern of behaviours, harassment can take the form of a single incident.</p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Percentage (%)</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS) Round 7, 2017</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>The pledge to leave no-one behind and eliminate discrimination is at the centre of the <a href=\"https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals?utm_source=EN&amp;utm_medium=GSR&amp;utm_content=US_UNDP_PaidSearch_Brand_English&amp;utm_campaign=CENTRAL&amp;c_src=CENTRAL&amp;c_src2=GSR&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAvK2bBhB8EiwAZUbP1LU6FpebpyoZ4oOSOWWfJNIAWeAIrzV00Qwkuf0f_vjzh2v88RrqhRo\">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a>.
