There are six, separate transactions which make up this indicator, they include an<br/>application for an electrical connection, an application for a water connection, an application for a<br/>construction-related permit, an application for an import license, an application for an operating license,<br/>and during an inspection/meeting with tax officials. In all of these transactions, if the respondent<br/>indicates \u2018yes\u2019 they had the transaction (e.g. they applied for an import license), then there is a follow-up<br/>question which asks if the respondent was expected to provide a gift or an informal payment during this transaction (an application or meeting). The response options include \u201cyes\u201d, \u201cno\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d,and<br/>\u201crefuse\u201d. Note that refusals are accepted and recorded but for the purposes of indicator construction,<br/>refusals are considered as a \u2018yes\u2019. The indicator 16.5.2 is measuring whether the respondent indicated<br/>\u2018yes\u2019 to a bribe payment for any of these six transactions.<br/>Enterprise Surveys are firm-level surveys conducted in World Bank client countries. The survey focuses on<br/>various aspects of the business environment as well as firm\u2019s outcome measures such as annual sales,<br/>productivity, etc. The surveys are conducted via face-to-face interviews with the top manager or business<br/>owner. For each country, the survey is conducted approximately every 4-5 years.<br/>Concepts:<br/>The respondents to the Enterprise Survey are firms- either manufacturing or services establishments.<br/>These are registered (formal) firms with 5+ employees. The firms are either fully or partially private<br/>(100% state-owned firms are ineligible for the Enterprise Survey). More information on the survey<br/>methodology can be found on the Methodology page of the website:<br/>www.enterprisesurveys.org/methodology<br/>A gift or an informal payment is considered a \u2018bribe\u2019.</p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Rank , Score </p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>Transparency International, 2016 - 2021</p>","REL_CAL_POLICY":"<p>Annually</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>Transparency International</p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<p>Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>The rationale for this indicator is to ascertain whether firms are solicited for gifts or informal payments (i.e. bribes) when undertaking transactions that involve public officials. Applying for regulatory licenses, obtaining utility connections, and paying taxes are required of formal forms in most countries and hence the rational for this indicator is to measure the incidence of corruption during these routine transactions. The key strength of the Enterprise Survey is that most of the questions in the survey pertain to the actual, day-to-day experiences of the firm; these questions regarding corruption are not opinion-based question but rather are grounded in the firm\u2019s day-to-day reality.</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>The indicator is calculated for each country, by looking at the proportion of firms which answered \u2018yes\u2019 to the survey questions. For all Enterprise Survey projects conducted since 2006, the resulting dataset has sampling weights. Hence the indicator value, which is computed using Stata, incorporates these sampling weights as well as the design strata.</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-10-21","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-10-21: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/0c4b7f73da270c2c7a2045325d058b4b8478923c","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Proportion of businesses that had at least one contact with a public official and that paid a bribe to a public official, or were asked for a bribe by those public officials during the previous 12 months","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Proportion of businesses that had at least one contact with a public official and that paid a bribe to a public official, or were asked for a bribe by those public officials during the previous 12 months","target_name":"Substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms","indicator_number":"16.5.2","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-16-05-02.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 216 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Transparency International","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2021/index/gha","source_url_text_1":"Corruption Perceptions Index","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Non-official","source_contact_1":"info@tighana.org","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"16.5.2","target_id":"16.5","sdg_goal":"16","indicator_sort_order":"16-05-02"}
