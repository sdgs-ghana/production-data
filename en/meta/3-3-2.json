The overall goal is to \u201cEnd the global tuberculosis epidemic\u201d, and correspondingly ambitious targets for reductions in tuberculosis deaths and cases are set for 2030 (80% reduction in incidence rate compared with the level of 2015) and 2035 (90% reduction in incidence rate), in the context of the SDGs.</p><p>The tuberculosis incidence rate was selected as an indicator for measuring reductions in the number of cases of disease burden. Although this indicator was estimated with considerable uncertainty in most countries in 2014, notifications of cases to national authorities provide a good proxy if there is limited under-reporting of detected cases and limited under or over-diagnosis of cases.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>The data has no disaggregation</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-10-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-10-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/999e04a95bda4aa30b6b71384e6445230c2e1b5f","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Per 100,000 population","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Tuberculosis incidence per 100,000 population","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Tuberculosis incidence per 100,000 population","target_name":"By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases","indicator_number":"3.3.2","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"World Health Organisation (WHO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-03-03-02.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 216 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Health","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2018,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www.moh.gov.gh/annual-reviews/","source_url_text_1":"Holistic Assessment of Health Sector Programme of Work","source_release_date_1":2018,"source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@moh.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"3.3.2","target_id":"3.3","sdg_goal":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-03-02"}
