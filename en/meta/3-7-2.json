Therefore, preventing births very early in a woman\u2019s life is an important measure to improve maternal health and reduce infant mortality. Furthermore, women having children at an early age experience reduced opportunities for socioeconomic advancement, particularly because young mothers are less likely to complete their education and, if they need to work, may find it especially difficult to combine family and work responsibilities. The adolescent birth rate also provides indirect evidence on access to pertinent health services since young people, and in particular unmarried adolescent women, often experience difficulties in access to sexual and reproductive health services.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>There is no available disaggregation for this indicator.</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-03-07-02.pdf\">SDG Indicators \u2014 SDG Indicators (un.org)</a></p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-11","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Adolescent birth rate (aged 10\u201314 years; aged 15\u201319 years) per 1,000 women in that age group","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Adolescent birth rate (aged 10\u201314 years; aged 15\u201319 years) per 1,000 women in that age group","target_name":"By 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes","indicator_number":"3.7.2","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-03-07-02.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 90.8 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_1":"","source_earliest_available_1":1993,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://dhsprogram.com/Publications/Publication-Search.cfm?ctry_id=14&country=Ghana","source_url_text_1":"Ghana Demographic and Health Survey","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_2":"","source_earliest_available_2":1993,"source_geographical_coverage_2":"Ghana","source_url_2":"https://www.statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/fileUpload/pressrelease/MICS%20SFR%20final_compressed.pdf","source_url_text_2":"Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, 2018","source_release_date_2":"","source_next_release_2":"","source_statistical_classification_2":"Official","source_contact_2":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"target_number":"3.7","goal_number":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-07-02"}
