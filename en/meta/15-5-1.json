Changes over time in the proportion of species threatened with extinction are largely driven by improvements in knowledge and changing taxonomy. The indicator excludes such changes to yield a more informative indicator than the simple proportion of threatened species. It therefore measures change in aggregate extinction risk across groups of species over time, resulting from genuine improvements or deteriorations in the status of individual species. It can be calculated for any representative set of species that have been assessed for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species at least twice (Butchart et al. 2004, 2005, 2007). To calculate the Red List Index for individual countries and regions, each species contributing to the index is weighted by the proportion of its global range within the particular country or region. The resulting index therefore shows the aggregate extinction risk for species within the country or region relative to its potential contribution to global species extinction risk (within the taxonomic groups included).</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>RMSC, Forestry Commission, 2020</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-06-16","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-06-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/6eaec674bdcfd8d0adfe0486b5d7a930b8d2bf43","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Red List Index","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Red List Index","indicator_number":"15.5.1","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"indicator":"15.5.1","target_id":"15.5","sdg_goal":"15","indicator_sort_order":"15-05-01"}
