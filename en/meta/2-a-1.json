An AOI less than 1 reflects a lower orientation to agriculture, while an AOI equal to 1 reflects neutrality in a government\u2019s orientation to the agriculture sector.</p><p>Government spending in agriculture includes spending on sector policies and programs; soil improvement and soil degradation control; irrigation and reservoirs for agricultural use; animal health management, livestock research and training in animal husbandry, marine/freshwater biological research, afforestation and other forestry projects etc.</p><p>Spending in these agricultural activities helps to increase sector efficiency, productivity and income growth by increasing physical or human capital and/or reducing inter-temporal budget constraints.</p><p>Government spending in agriculture is essential to address these market failures and the periodic need for income redistribution. This leads to several potential indicators for the SDGs, which include: a) the level of Government Expenditure on Agriculture (GEA); b) the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure, and c) the AOI for Government Expenditures.</p><p>The AOI index takes into account a country\u2019s economic size, Agriculture\u2019s contribution to GDP, and the total amount of Government Expenditure. While the indicator does not allow setting of a universal and achievable target, it is useful to interpret the AOI in combination with its numerator and denominator separately: the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure and the Agriculture value-added Share of GDP.</p>","DATA_VALIDATION":"<p>Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI): Total Agriculture Share of Government Expenditures expressed as a percentage of Agriculture value added Share of GDP. </p><p>Where:</p><p>Agriculture Share of Government Expenditure:  Total Government Expenditure on Agriculture expressed as a percentage of Total Government (Public) expenditure.</p><p>Agriculture here refers to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Classification_of_the_functions_of_government_(COFOG)\">COFOG category 042</a> (agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting); and</p><p>Agriculture value added Share of GDP : Total Agriculture value added expressed as a percentage of GDP. </p><p>Agriculture here  refers to the <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/seriesm/seriesm_4rev4e.pdf\">Division A of ISIC Rev 4</a> (agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting), equal to Division A+B of ISIC Rev 3.2.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>There is no available disaggregation for this indicator.</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-02-0A-01.pdf\">SDG Indicators \u2014 SDG Indicators (un.org)</a></p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-16","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"The agriculture orientation index for government expenditures","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"The agriculture orientation index for government expenditures","target_name":"Increase investment, including through enhanced international cooperation, in rural infrastructure, agricultural research and extension services, technology development and plant and livestock gene banks in order to enhance agricultural productive capacity in developing countries, in particular least developed countries","indicator_number":"2.a.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-02-0A-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 223 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2016,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www.statsghana.gov.gh/Economics.php?category=NTgwNjExMjQ4LjI4Mw==/webstats/67q2s8ro6q","source_url_text_1":"National Accounts","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"target_number":"2.a","goal_number":"2","indicator_sort_order":"02-0a-01"}
