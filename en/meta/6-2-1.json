Unsafe management of human excreta and poor sanitation practices are closely associated with diarrhea diseases, which exacerbate malnutrition and remain a major public health concern and a leading global cause of child deaths, as well as parasitic infections such as soil transmitted helminths (worms) and a range of other neglected tropical diseases. While access to a hygienic toilet facility is essential for reducing the transmission of pathogens, it is equally important to ensure safe management, treatment and disposal of the excreta produced. Lack of access to suitable sanitation and hygiene facilities is a major cause of risks and anxiety, especially for women and girls. For all these reasons, access to sanitation and hygiene services that prevent disease, provide privacy and ensure dignity has been recognized as a basic human right. As a result, the SDG indicator 6.2.1. (a) is designed to address safe management of sanitation services along the sanitation chain, including containment, emptying, treatment and disposal of waste. </p>","COVERAGE":"<p>There is no available disaggregation for this indicator.</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/3UAwcu3\">http://bit.ly/3UAwcu3</a> </p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-13","composite_breakdown_label":"Type of Toilet","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Proportion of population using (a) safely managed sanitation services and (b) a hand-washing facility with soap and water","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"Proportion of population using (a) safely managed sanitation services and (b) a hand-washing facility with soap and water","target_name":"By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations","indicator_number":"6.2.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"World Health Organisation (WHO), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEFF)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-06-02-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 271 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"World Health Organization (WHO) / United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)","source_periodicity_1":"Biennial","source_earliest_available_1":2000,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"","source_url_1":"https://washdata.org/data/household#!/table?geo0=country&geo1=GHA","source_url_text_1":"WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene","source_release_date_1":"01/07/2021","source_next_release_1":"01/07/2023","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official international","source_contact_1":"info@washdata.org","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_2":"","source_earliest_available_2":"","source_geographical_coverage_2":"","source_url_2":"https://www.statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/fileUpload/pressrelease/GLSS7%20MAIN%20REPORT_FINAL.pdf","source_url_text_2":"Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS) Round 7, 2019","source_release_date_2":"june, 2019","source_next_release_2":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_2":"Official","source_contact_2":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_3":true,"source_organisation_3":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_3":"","source_earliest_available_3":"","source_geographical_coverage_3":"","source_url_3":"https://www.statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/fileUpload/pressrelease/MICS%20SFR%20final_compressed.pdf","source_url_text_3":"Ghana Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey(MICS), 2018","source_release_date_3":"","source_next_release_3":"","source_statistical_classification_3":"Official","source_contact_3":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"target_number":"6.2","goal_number":"6","indicator_sort_order":"06-02-01"}
