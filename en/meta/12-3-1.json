Losses that occur during storage, transportation and processing, also of imported quantities, are therefore all included. Losses include the commodity as a whole with its non-edible parts.</p><p>Post Harvest Loss is the quantitative losses in storage, transport, harvest and marketing of agricultural produce incurred after harvest. Percentage of total production that is lost (quantitative and qualitative) during all stages of the post-harvest phases of the system for priority products. For the purpose of this report, post-harvest losses (PHL) are restricted to the losses that occur during harvesting, storage, transport, processing, packaging and sales.</p><p><strong><u>Related concepts</u></strong></p><p><strong>Food</strong> \u2013 is any substance, whether processed, semi-processed or raw, which is intended for human consumption, and includes drink, chewing gum and any substance which has been used in the manufacture, preparation or treatment of \"food\" but does not include cosmetics or tobacco or substances used only as drugs.</p><p> <strong>Food loss and waste (FLW)</strong> \u2013 is the decrease in quantity or quality of food. </p><p> <strong>Quantitative food loss and waste</strong> \u2013 is the decrease in mass of food. </p><p><strong>Pre-harvest </strong>constitutes the time frame between maturity and harvesting. </p><p><strong>Harvest/slaughter/catch</strong> refers to the act of separating the food material from the site of immediate growth or production.</p><p><strong><u>Food Loss Index scope and boundaries</u></strong></p><ul><li>The scope of the Food Loss Index starts on the production site with postharvest/slaughter/catch operations up to but not including the retail level, in line with the Food Balance Sheets conceptual framework.</li><li>The index covers five food groups and 10 key commodities set by the countries. </li><li>Harvest losses can be included in the index at the country level only. </li><li>Pre-harvest losses are out of scope.</li><li>Sub-Indicator 12.3.1(b) Food Waste Index covers food waste at the retail and consumption level.</li></ul><p>Note: Figures available are estimates.

It does not include cosmetics, tobacco, or substances used only as drugs. It does not include processing agents used along the food supply chain, for example, water to clean or cook raw materials in factories or at home.</p><p>Inedible (or non-edible) parts: Components associated with a food that, in a particular food supply chain, are not intended to be consumed by humans. Examples of inedible parts associated with food could include bones, rinds, and pits/stones. \u201cInedible parts\u201d do not include packaging. What is considered inedible varies among users (e.g., chicken feet are consumed in some food supply chains but not others), changes over time, and is influenced by a range of variables including culture, socio-economic factors, availability, price, technological advances, international trade, and geography.</p><p>Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) includes waste originating from households, commerce, and trade, small businesses, office buildings and institutions (schools, hospitals, government buildings). It also includes bulky waste (e.g., old furniture, mattresses) and waste from selected municipal services, e.g., waste from park and garden maintenance, waste from street cleaning services (street sweepings, the content of litter containers, market cleansing waste), if managed as waste. Further information on municipal solid waste is defined in the SDG indicator methodology for 11.6.1.</p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Food loss: Percentage; Food waste: Percentage (%), Tonnes, KG</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p> Annual Progress Report, Ministry of Food and Agriculture, 2019</p>","FREQ_COLL":"<p>Annually</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>Ministry of Food and Agriculture</p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<p>Ghana Statistical Service</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>The 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda has emphasized the importance of sustainable production and consumption systems as efficient food systems, on the supply side and the consumption side, contribute to food security and sustainability of natural resource since agriculture is a major user of land and water. The food loss and food waste index look at the entire supply chain and the trend in structural losses. The Food Loss Index monitors progress on the supply side of food chains, as it measures if the share of agriculture production that does not reach the retail stage in 2030 has increased or decreased with respect to the base period and by how much. The numerator of the indicator indicates the level of losses and informs on the magnitude of the problem. A greater efficiency of the food supply chain also has implications for all producers whether looking at efficiency in large-scale producers for export markets or in small-scale production units relevant for poverty and food insecurity reduction goal</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>Total post harvest losses divided by total production and multiplied by 100</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/\">SDG Indicators \u2014 SDG Indicators (un.org)</a></p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-10-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-10-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/8b48184d7d6b6f550c672990684c4b8b7bf3b580","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percent","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Post-harvest losses for selected produce","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"(a) Food loss index and (b) food waste index","target_name":"By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses","indicator_number":"12.3.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), UN Environment (UNEP)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/tierIII-indicators/files/Tier3-12-03-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 4.0 MB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"World Bank","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2004,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY?locations=GB","source_url_text_1":"Poverty headcount ratio at $1.90 a day (2011 PPP) (% of population)","source_release_date_1":"28/05/2020","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Non-official","source_contact_1":"Research@WorldBank.org","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"12.3.1","target_id":"12.3","sdg_goal":"12","indicator_sort_order":"12-03-01"}
