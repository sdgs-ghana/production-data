{"SDG_INDICATOR_INFO":"<p>Post Harvest Loss is the quantitative losses in storage, transport, harvest and marketing of agricultural produce incurred after harvest. Percentage of total production that is lost (quantitative and qualitative) during all stages of the post-harvest phases of the system for priority products.

Losses that occur during storage, transportation and processing, also of imported quantities, are therefore all included.
