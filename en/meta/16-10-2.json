Ghana joined the [open data government partnership](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/open-data/) in 2011 before passing the Right to Information (RTI) bill, which identified open data as a focus area in order to achieve transparent and accountable governance and create a community of data suppliers and users.  The RTI's passing is a positive development that will strengthen the nation's open data movement.","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":["Non-statistical"],"indicator":"16.10.2","target_id":"16.10","sdg_goal":"16","indicator_sort_order":"16-10-02"}
