Women\u2019s participation in parliaments is a key aspect of women\u2019s opportunities in political and public life, and is therefore linked to women\u2019s empowerment. Equal numbers of women and men in lower chambers would give an indicator value of 50 percent. A stronger presence of women in parliament allows new concerns to be highlighted on political agendas, and new priorities to be put into practice through the adoption and implementation of policies and laws. The inclusion of the perspectives and interests of women is a prerequisite for democracy and gender equality, and contributes to good governance. A representative parliament also allows the different experiences of men and women to affect the social, political and economic future of societies. Although the international community has supported and promoted women\u2019s participation in political decision-making structures for several decades, improvement in women\u2019s access to parliament has been slow. This has led to the introduction of special policy and legal measures to increase women\u2019s shares of parliamentary seats in Ghana. </p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>(1) Number of seats in national parliament occupied by women divided by the total number of seats in national parliament, multiplied by 100 </p><p>(2) Number of seats in local assemblies occupied by women divided by the total number of seats in local assemblies, multiplied by 100</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-12","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-11-12: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/3a204447b9247d459e0c7500f8d3f6dac5e18f97","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Proportion of seats held by women in (a) national parliaments and (b) local governments","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_name":"Proportion of seats held by women in (a) national parliaments and (b) local governments","target_name":"Ensure women\u2019s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life","indicator_number":"5.5.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), UN Women","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/?Text=&Goal=5&Target=5.5","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 4.0 MB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"National Development Planning Commission (NDPC)","source_periodicity_1":"","source_earliest_available_1":2016,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://ndpc.gov.gh/media/2020_SDGs_Report-Final.pdf","source_url_text_1":"Ghana's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Report, 2020","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@ndpc.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"5.5.1","target_id":"5.5","sdg_goal":"5","indicator_sort_order":"05-05-01"}
