This, in turn, is premised on aspects of the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. From a development perspective, extensive use of pre-sentence detention when not necessary for reasons such as the prevention of absconding, the protection of victims or witnesses, or the prevention of the commission of further offences, can divert criminal justice system resources, and exert financial and unemployment burdens on the accused and his or her family. Measuring the relative extent to which pre-sentence detention is used can provide the evidence to assist countries in lowering such burdens and ensuring its proportionate use.</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>The total number of unsentenced persons held in detention divided by the total number of persons held in detention, on a specified date.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>There is no available disaggregation for this indicator.</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-11","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-11-11: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/172929d564f4497593a8718e8742b0d2ebf50ad0","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.16-3-2-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.16-3-2-title","target_name":"global_targets.16-3-title","indicator_number":"16.3.2","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-16-03-02.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 209 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ghana Prisons Service","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://ghanaprisons.gov.gh/news/downloads.cits","source_url_text_1":"Ghana Prisons Service Annual Report","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@ghanaprisons.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"16.3.2","target_id":"16.3","sdg_goal":"16","indicator_sort_order":"16-03-02"}
