One of the largest pressures on coastal environments is eutrophication, resulting primarily from land-based nutrient input from agricultural runoff and domestic wastewater discharge. Coastal eutrophication can lead to serious damage to marine ecosystems, vital sea habitats, and can cause the spread of harmful algal blooms. Marine litter is found in all the world\u2019s oceans and seas. It constitutes an increasing risk to ecosystem health and biodiversity while entailing substantial economic costs through its impacts on public health, tourism, fishing and aquaculture. Target 14.1 aims to reduce the impacts of pollution through prevention and reduction of marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution.</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>Plastic count per km<sup>2</sup> = (1,000,000*number of plastics found)/(total area cleaned)</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>There is no available disaggregation for this indicator.</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-10-10","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Plastic count per square kilometer","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.14-1-1-title","graph_titles":[{"series":"(a) Index of coastal eutrophication; and (b) plastic debris density","title":"Beach litter per square kilometer"}],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.14-1-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.14-1-title","indicator_number":"14.1.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"UN Environment (UNEP)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/tierIII-indicators/files/Tier3-14-01-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 4.0 MB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"TIDES database","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www.coastalcleanupdata.org/","source_url_text_1":"TIDES database","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Non-official","source_contact_1":"memberservices@oceanconservancy.org","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"target_number":"14.1","goal_number":"14","indicator_sort_order":"14-01-01"}
