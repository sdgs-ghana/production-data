The establishment of protected areas is an important mechanism for achieving this aim, and this indicator serves as a means of measuring progress toward the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of marine ecosystems and their services, in line with obligations under international agreements. In addition to protecting biodiversity, protected areas have high social and economic value: supporting local livelihoods; maintaining fisheries; harbouring an untold wealth of genetic resources; supporting thriving recreation and tourism industries; providing for science, research and education; and forming a basis for cultural and other non-material values. This indicator adds meaningful information to, complements and builds from traditionally reported simple statistics of marine area covered by protected areas. The indicator was used to track progress towards the <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/doc/strategic-plan/Post2020/postsbi/ibn.pdf\">2011\u20132020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014, CBD 2020a)</a>, and was used as an indicator towards the <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/2010-target\">Convention on Biological Diversity\u2019s 2010 Target (Butchart et al. 2010)</a>.
