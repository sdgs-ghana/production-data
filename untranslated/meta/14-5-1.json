The establishment of protected areas is an important mechanism for achieving this aim, and this indicator serves as a means of measuring progress toward the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of marine ecosystems and their services, in line with obligations under international agreements. Importantly, while it can be disaggregated to report on any given single ecosystem of interest, it is not restricted to any single ecosystem type. Levels of access to protected areas vary among the protected area management categories. Some areas, such as scientific reserves, are maintained in their natural state and closed to any other use. Others are used for recreation or tourism, or even open for the sustainable extraction of natural resources. In addition to protecting biodiversity, protected areas have high social and economic value: supporting local livelihoods; maintaining fisheries; harbouring an untold wealth of genetic resources; supporting thriving recreation and tourism industries; providing for science, research and education; and forming a basis for cultural and other non-material values. This indicator adds meaningful information to, complements and builds from traditionally reported simple statistics of marine area covered by protected areas, computed by dividing the total protected area within a country by the total territorial area of the country and multiplying by 100 (e.g., Chape et al. 2005). Such percentage area coverage statistics do not recognise the extreme variation of biodiversity importance over space (Rodrigues et al. 2004), and so risk generating perverse outcomes through the protection of areas which are large at the expense of those which require protection. The indicator was used to track progress towards the 2011\u20132020 Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (CBD 2014, Tittensor et al. 2014, CBD 2020a), and was used as an indicator towards the Convention on Last updated: 2022-07-07 Biological Diversity\u2019s 2010 Target (Butchart et al. 2010). It has been proposed as an indicator for monitoring progress towards the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (CBD 2020b).</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/metadata_documentation\">https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/tree/draft/metadata_documentation</a></p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/blob/draft/yearly_results/README.md#global-ohi-score-metadata\">https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/blob/draft/yearly_results/README.md#global-ohi-score-metadata</a></p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-10-31","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-10-31: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/64ac80420b6ea6c3215336015993e3085db15c88","composite_breakdown_label":"OHI Goal/subgoal","computation_units":"Score","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":"","embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.14-5-1-title","graph_titles":[{"series":"Ocean Health Index","title":"Ocean Health Index"}],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.14-5-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.14-5-title","indicator_number":"14.5.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), BirdLife International (BLI), International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-14-05-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 293 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ocean Health Index","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2004,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://oceanhealthindex.org/global-scores/","source_url_text_1":"The global Ocean Health Index","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Non-official","source_contact_1":"clawson@nceas.ucsb.edu","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"14.5.1","target_id":"14.5","sdg_goal":"14","indicator_sort_order":"14-05-01"}
