Services such as savings, insurance, payments, credit and remittances allow people to manage their lives, plan and pay expenses, grow their businesses and improve their overall welfare. As banks remain one of the key institutions for access to formal financial services, having an accessible bank branch is an important initial point of access to financial services and therefore use of them. Bank branches are complemented by other important points of access such as automated teller machines of all formal financial institutions, which can extend financial services to remote locations.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>There is no available disaggregation for this indicator.</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-08-10-01.pdf \">SDG Indicators \u2014 SDG Indicators</a></p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-12","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-11-12: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/cd17475b63da5b7ed4dba4e78dcb0784f328a8b5","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Per 100,000 population","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.8-10-1-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.8-10-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.8-10-title","indicator_number":"8.10.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"International Monetary Fund (IMF)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-08-10-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 411 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Bank of Ghana (BoG)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2010,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www.bog.gov.gh/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/AnnRep-2019.pdf","source_url_text_1":"Bank of Ghana (BoG), Annual Report 2019","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"bogsecretary@bog.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"8.10.1","target_id":"8.10","sdg_goal":"8","indicator_sort_order":"08-10-01"}
