Renewable energy technologies represent a major element in strategies for greening economies everywhere in the world and for tackling the critical global problem of climate change. Importantly, this indicator focuses on the amount of renewable energy actually consumed rather than the capacity for renewable energy production, which cannot always be fully utilized. By focusing on consumption by the end user, it avoids the distortions caused by the fact that conventional energy sources are subject to significant energy losses along the production chain.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>There is no available disaggregation for this indicator.</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-renewable-energy\">https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-renewable-energy</a> </p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-13","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.7-2-1-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.7-2-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.7-2-title","indicator_number":"7.2.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"International Energy Agency (IEA), United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), United Nations' inter-agency mechanism on energy (UN Energy) and the SE4ALL Global Tracking Framework Consortium","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-07-02-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 216 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Energy Commission","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"http://www.energycom.gov.gh/planning/energy-statistics","source_url_text_1":"National Energy Statistics","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"statistics@energycom.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"target_number":"7.2","goal_number":"7","indicator_sort_order":"07-02-01"}
