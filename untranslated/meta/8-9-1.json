While sustainable tourism is multidimensional in itself (with economic, social and environmental aspects), the economic contribution of tourism captured by this indicator, and (relative) increases or decreases in it, indicates the degree to which tourism is being successfully promoted. Ideally, this indicator needs to be complemented with additional indicators on the social (e.g. employment, etc.) and environmental (energy use, GHG emissions, etc.) aspects of tourism that can be disaggregated to provide a more complete picture of the promotion of sustainable tourism and thus the monitoring of this target. This indicator is useful for policies on tourism at international, national level and the level of sub-national regions as it provides a measure of the economic contribution of tourism. The indicator has been found especially useful in raising awareness of the economic importance of tourism and making the case for a more proactive, sustainable management of a sector that is often overlooked in policy agendas at all levels.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>There is no available disaggregation for this indicator.</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-08-09-01.pdf\">SDG Indicators \u2014 SDG Indicators (un.org)</a> </p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-12","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.8-9-1-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.8-9-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.8-9-title","indicator_number":"8.9.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"World Tourism Organization (UNTWO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-08-09-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 526 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2015,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www.statsghana.gov.gh/Economics.php?category=NTgwNjExMjQ4LjI4Mw==/webstats/67q2s8ro6q","source_url_text_1":"National Accounts, 2022","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"target_number":"8.9","goal_number":"8","indicator_sort_order":"08-09-01"}
