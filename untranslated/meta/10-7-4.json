It also explicitly states that Member States resolve to take further effective measures and actions, to \u201cstrengthen support and meet the special needs of people living in areas affected by complex humanitarian emergencies\u201d. In addition, target 10.7 recognizes for the first time the contribution of migration to sustainable development by aiming to \u201cfacilitate orderly, safe, and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies\u201d.</p><p>This indicator tracks the number of people displaced across national borders as a result of persecution, conflict, violence, human rights violations, or events seriously disturbing public order.
