An AOI less than 1 reflects a lower orientation to agriculture, while an AOI equal to 1 reflects neutrality in a government\u2019s orientation to the agriculture sector.</p><p>Government spending in agriculture includes spending on sector policies and programs; soil improvement and soil degradation control; irrigation and reservoirs for agricultural use; animal health management, livestock research and training in animal husbandry, marine/freshwater biological research, afforestation and other forestry projects etc.</p><p>Spending in these agricultural activities helps to increase sector efficiency, productivity and income growth by increasing physical or human capital and/or reducing inter-temporal budget constraints.</p><p>Government spending in agriculture is essential to address these market failures and the periodic need for income redistribution. This leads to several potential indicators for the SDGs, which include: a) the level of Government Expenditure on Agriculture (GEA); b) the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure, and c) the AOI for Government Expenditures.</p><p>The AOI index takes into account a country\u2019s economic size, Agriculture\u2019s contribution to GDP, and the total amount of Government Expenditure. While the indicator does not allow setting of a universal and achievable target, it is useful to interpret the AOI in combination with its numerator and denominator separately: the Agriculture share of Government Expenditure and the Agriculture value-added Share of GDP.</p>","DATA_VALIDATION":"<p>Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI): Total Agriculture Share of Government Expenditures expressed as a percentage of Agriculture value added Share of GDP. </p><p>Where:</p><p>Agriculture Share of Government Expenditure:  Total Government Expenditure on Agriculture expressed as a percentage of Total Government (Public) expenditure.</p><p>Agriculture here refers to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Classification_of_the_functions_of_government_(COFOG)\">COFOG category 042</a> (agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting); and</p><p>Agriculture value added Share of GDP : Total Agriculture value added expressed as a percentage of GDP. </p><p>Agriculture here  refers to the <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/publication/seriesm/seriesm_4rev4e.pdf\">Division A of ISIC Rev 4</a> (agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting), equal to Division A+B of ISIC Rev 3.2.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>There is no available disaggregation for this indicator.</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-02-0A-01.pdf\">SDG Indicators \u2014 SDG Indicators (un.org)</a></p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-08","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-11-08: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/e63f60522e4f786ab12be0e93d0e2f129fd6c245","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.2-a-1-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.2-a-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.2-a-title","indicator_number":"2.a.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-02-0A-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 223 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2016,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www.statsghana.gov.gh/Economics.php?category=NTgwNjExMjQ4LjI4Mw==/webstats/67q2s8ro6q","source_url_text_1":"National Accounts","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"","source_statistical_classification_1":"Non-official","source_contact_1":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"2.a.1","target_id":"2.a","sdg_goal":"2","indicator_sort_order":"02-0a-01"}
