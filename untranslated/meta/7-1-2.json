These guidelines provide technical recommendations in the form of emissions targets for as to what fuels and technology (stove, lamp, and so on) combinations in the home are clean. These guidelines also recommend against the use of unprocessed coal and discourage the use kerosene (a non-solid but highly polluting fuel) in the home.

For cooking and heating, households typically rely on solid fuels (such as wood, charcoal, biomass) or kerosene paired with inefficient technologies (e.g. open fires, stoves, space heaters or lamps). It is well known that reliance on such inefficient energy for cooking, heating and lighting is associated with high levels of household (indoor) air pollution. The use of inefficient fuels for cooking alone is estimated to cause over 4 million deaths annually, mainly among women and children. This is more than Tuberculosis, Human Immunodeficiency Virus and malaria combined. These adverse health impacts can be avoided by adopting clean fuels and technologies for all main household energy end-or in some circumstances by adopting advanced combustion cook stoves (i.e. those which achieve the emission rates targets provided by the WHO guidelines) and adopting strict protocols for their safe use. Given the importance of clean and safe household energy use as a human development issue, universal access to energy among the technical practitioner community is currently taken to mean access to both electricity and clean fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting. For this reason, clean cooking forms part of the universal access objective under the UN Secretary General\u2019s Sustainable Energy for All initiative</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-10-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-10-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/8b48184d7d6b6f550c672990684c4b8b7bf3b580","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percent","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":["URBANISATION"],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.7-1-2-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.7-1-2-title","target_name":"global_targets.7-1-title","indicator_number":"7.1.2","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"International Trade Centre (ITC), United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), The World Trade Organization (WTO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-07-01-02.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 232 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Energy Commission","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"http://www.energycom.gov.gh/planning/energy-statistics","source_url_text_1":"National Energy Statistics","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"statistics@energycom.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"7.1.2","target_id":"7.1","sdg_goal":"7","indicator_sort_order":"07-01-02"}
