This single measure captures a good part of the lack of access to clean cooking fuels but fails to collect data on type of device or technology is used for cooking, and also fails to capture other polluting forms of energy use in the home such as those used for lighting and heating.</p><p>New evidence-based normative guidance from the WHO (i.e. WHO Guidelines for indoor air quality guidelines: household fuel combustion), highlights the importance of addressing both fuel and the technology for adequately protecting public health. These guidelines provide technical recommendations in the form of emissions targets for as to what fuels and technology (stove, lamp, and so on) combinations in the home are clean. These guidelines also recommend against the use of unprocessed coal and discourage the use kerosene (a non-solid but highly polluting fuel) in the home. They also recommend that all major household energy end uses (e.g. cooking, space heating, lighting) use efficient fuels and technology combinations to ensure health benefits.</p><p>For this reason, the technical recommendations in the WHO guidelines, access to modern cooking solution in the home will be defined as \u201caccess to clean fuels and technologies\u201d rather than \u201caccess to non-solid fuels.\u201d This shift will help ensure that health and other \u201cnexus\u201d benefits are better counted, and thus realized.</p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Percent</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>GLSS Rounds 6, 2014; GLSS Round 7, 2019; and PBB of MoE,2019</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-06-16","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-06-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/6eaec674bdcfd8d0adfe0486b5d7a930b8d2bf43","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.7-1-2-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.7-1-2-title","indicator_number":"7.1.2","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"indicator":"7.1.2","target_id":"7.1","sdg_goal":"7","indicator_sort_order":"07-01-02"}
