When computed for the whole economy, it combines effects of the average carbon intensity of the energy mix (linked to the shares of the various fossil fuels in the total); of the structure of an economy (linked to the relative weight of more or less energy-intensive sectors); of the average efficiency in the use of energy. When computed for the manufacturing sector (CO2 emissions from fuel combustion per unit of manufacturing value added), it measures the carbon intensity of the manufacturing economic output, and its trends result from changes in the average carbon intensity of the energy mix used, the structure of the manufacturing sector, the energy efficiency of production technologies in each sub-sector and the economic value of the various output.  It should be noted that emission intensities can  be reduced through structural changes and product diversification in manufacturing.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>This data Is disaggregated by sectors.</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-11-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/ba4846af8f926eb64d6ade3a8822de77ac2dc530","composite_breakdown_label":"Sector","computation_units":"kg CO2 equivalent per constant 2010 GDP $","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.9-4-1-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.9-4-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.9-4-title","indicator_number":"9.4.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"International Energy Agency (IEA), United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-09-04-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 516 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2017,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"","source_url_text_1":"Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 2020","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/forms/contact-epa","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"9.4.1","target_id":"9.4","sdg_goal":"9","indicator_sort_order":"09-04-01"}
