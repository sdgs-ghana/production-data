The first edition of the indicator will provide a baseline of the current state of implementation of these agreements. Subsequent indicator estimates will then be able to show any progress made by countries.IUU fishing greatly disadvantages and discriminates against those fishers that act responsibly, honestly and in accordance with the terms of their fishing authorizations. This is a compelling reason why IUU fishing must be dealt with expeditiously and in a transparent manner. If IUU fishing is not curbed, and if IUU fishers target vulnerable stocks that are subject to strict management controls or moratoria, efforts to rebuild those stocks to healthy levels will not be achieved. To efficiently curb IUU fishing a number of different international instruments have been developed over the years that focus on the implementation of the different responsibilities of States.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>There is no available disaggregation for this indicator.</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-11-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/eba7d57367b41d5566099d0f39272c42b1a73d37","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Band","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.14-6-1-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_name":"global_indicators.14-6-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.14-6-title","indicator_number":"14.6.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-14-06-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 4.0 MB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)","source_periodicity_1":"","source_earliest_available_1":2018,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/faoweb/statistics/SDG/April_2022/14.6.1_Progress_in_implementation_of_international_instruments_aiming_to_combat_IUU_fishing.xlsx","source_url_text_1":"Progress in the degree of implementation of instruments to combat IUU fishing, 2018\u20132022","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official international","source_contact_1":"FAO-HQ@fao.org","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"14.6.1","target_id":"14.6","sdg_goal":"14","indicator_sort_order":"14-06-01"}
