Unsafe management of human excreta and poor sanitation practices are closely associated with diarrhea diseases, which exacerbate malnutrition and remain a major public health concern and a leading global cause of child deaths, as well as parasitic infections such as soil transmitted helminths (worms) and a range of other neglected tropical diseases. While access to a hygienic toilet facility is essential for reducing the transmission of pathogens, it is equally important to ensure safe management, treatment and disposal of the excreta produced. Lack of access to suitable sanitation and hygiene facilities is a major cause of risks and anxiety, especially for women and girls. For all these reasons, access to sanitation and hygiene services that prevent disease, provide privacy and ensure dignity has been recognized as a basic human right. As a result, the SDG indicator 6.2.1. (a) is designed to address safe management of sanitation services along the sanitation chain, including containment, emptying, treatment and disposal of waste. </p>","COVERAGE":"<p>There is no available disaggregation for this indicator.</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://www.who.int/teams/environment-climate-change-and-health/water-sanitation-and-health/monitoring-and-evidence/wash-monitoring#:~:text=The%20WHO%2FUNICEF%20Joint%20Monitoring,hygiene%20(WASH)%20since%201990.\">https://www.who.int/teams/environment-climate-change-and-health/water-sanitation-and-health/monitoring-and-evidence/wash-monitoring#:~:text=The%20WHO%2FUNICEF%20Joint%20Monitoring,hygiene%20(WASH)%20since%201990.</a></p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-10-20","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-10-20: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/786eac1a3cc3c27e2d81327a8ed3fad3b5ce1df4","composite_breakdown_label":"Type of Toilet","computation_units":"Percent","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.6-2-1-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_name":"global_indicators.6-2-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.6-2-title","indicator_number":"6.2.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"World Health Organisation (WHO), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEFF)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-06-02-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 271 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene","source_periodicity_1":"Biennial","source_earliest_available_1":2000,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"","source_url_1":"https://washdata.org/data/household#!/table?geo0=country&geo1=GHA","source_url_text_1":"WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene","source_release_date_1":"01/07/2021","source_next_release_1":"01/07/2023","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official international","source_contact_1":"info@washdata.org","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"6.2.1","target_id":"6.2","sdg_goal":"6","indicator_sort_order":"06-02-01"}
