Surveys are carried out in a specific period of the year, usually over a few months. However, this indicator can be affected by seasonality, factors related to food availability (e.g. pre-harvest periods (i.e rainy season) and diseases (e.g. diarrhoea, malaria,\u2026 etc.)) and  natural disasters and conflicts.
