This assumes no restriction of interconnection to the network. It does not include overload capacity that can only be sustained for a short period of time (e.g., internal combustion engines<br/>momentarily running above their rated capacity).<br/>The IRENA Statute defines renewable energy to include energy from the following sources: hydropower; marine energy (ocean, tidal and wave energy); wind energy; solar energy (photovoltaic and thermal energy); bioenergy; and geothermal energy.</p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Watts per capita</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>National Energy Statistics, 2021</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>Energy Commission </p>","RATIONALE":"<p>The focus of this indicator on electricity reflects the<br/>emphasis of the target on modern sources of energy and is particularly relevant for developing countries where the demand for electricity is often high and its availability is constrained. Furthermore, the focus on renewables reflects the fact that the technologies used to produce renewable electricity are generally modern and more sustainable than non-renewables, particularly in the fastest growing sub-sectors of<br/>electricity generation from wind and solar energy.<br/>It uses population rather than GDP to scale the data, because this is the most basic indicator of the demand for modern and sustainable energy services in a country. With respect to electricity access, it will provide additional information to the proportion of people with electricity access by showing how much infrastructure is available to deliver that access (in terms of the amount of capacity per person). The focus on renewable capacity will also add value to the existing renewables indicator (7.2.1) by showing how much renewable energy is contributing to the need for improved electricity access.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p> There is no available disaggregatin for this indcator.</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-10-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-10-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/8b48184d7d6b6f550c672990684c4b8b7bf3b580","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Watts per capita","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.7-b-1-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.7-b-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.7-b-title","indicator_number":"7.b.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-07-0b-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Energy Commission","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"http://www.energycom.gov.gh/planning/energy-statistics","source_url_text_1":"National Energy Statistics","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"statistics@energycom.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"7.b.1","target_id":"7.b","sdg_goal":"7","indicator_sort_order":"07-0b-01"}
