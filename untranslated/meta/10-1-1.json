Shared prosperity explicitly recognizes that while growth is necessary for improving economic welfare in a society, progress is measured by how those gains are shared with its poorest members. Moreover, in an inclusive society it is not sufficient to raise everyone above an absolute minimum standard of living; it must ensure that economic growth increases prosperity among the poor over time.The decision to measure shared prosperity based on income or consumption was not taken to ignore the many other dimensions of welfare. It is motivated by the need for an indicator that is easy to understand, communicate, and measure\u2014though measurement challenges exist. </p>","COVERAGE":"<p>There is no available disaggregation for this indicator. </p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-09","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.10-1-1-title","graph_titles":[{"series":"Expenditure share of the bottom 40 percent of the population","title":"Expenditure share of the bottom 40 percent of the population"}],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.10-1-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.10-1-title","indicator_number":"10.1.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"World Bank (WB)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-10-01-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 221 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2013,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www.statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/fileUpload/pressrelease/GLSS7%20MAIN%20REPORT_FINAL.pdf","source_url_text_1":"Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS)","source_release_date_1":"June, 2019","source_next_release_1":"","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"target_number":"10.1","goal_number":"10","indicator_sort_order":"10-01-01"}
