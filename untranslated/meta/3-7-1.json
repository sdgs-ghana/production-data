Access to and use of an effective means to prevent pregnancy helps enable women and their partners to exercise their rights to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information, education and means to do so. Meeting demand for family planning with modern methods also contributes to maternal and child health by preventing unintended pregnancies and closely spaced pregnancies, which are at higher risk for poor obstetrical outcomes.</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>Currently married or sexually active women 15-49 years who have their need for family planning met with modern methods divided by Currently married or sexually active women 15-49 years multiplied by 100</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>There is no available disaggregation for this indicator.</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"http://measuredhs.com/Topics/Unmet-Need.cfm\">http://measuredhs.com/Topics/Unmet-Need.cfm</a> </p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-10","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.3-7-1-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.3-7-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.3-7-title","indicator_number":"3.7.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Population Fund UNFPA","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-03-07-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 357 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_1":"","source_earliest_available_1":1998,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://dhsprogram.com/Publications/Publication-Search.cfm?ctry_id=14&country=Ghana","source_url_text_1":"Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS), 2014","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_2":"","source_earliest_available_2":"","source_geographical_coverage_2":"Ghana","source_url_2":"https://www.statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/fileUpload/pressrelease/MICS%20SFR%20final_compressed.pdf","source_url_text_2":"Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), 2017/18","source_release_date_2":"","source_next_release_2":"","source_statistical_classification_2":"Official","source_contact_2":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"target_number":"3.7","goal_number":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-07-01"}
