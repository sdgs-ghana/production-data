The components of the indicator are contraceptive prevalence (any method and modern methods) and unmet need for family planning.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Contraceptive prevalence is the percentage of women who are currently using, or whose partner is currently using, at least one method of contraception, regardless of the method used.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>For analytical purposes, contraceptive methods are often classified as either modern or traditional. Modern methods of contraception include female and male sterilization, the intra-uterine device (IUD), the implant, injectables, oral contraceptive pills, male and female condoms, vaginal barrier methods (including the diaphragm, cervical cap and spermicidal foam, jelly, cream and sponge), lactational amenorrhea method (LAM), emergency contraception and other modern methods not reported separately (e.g., the contraceptive patch or vaginal ring). Traditional methods of contraception include rhythm (e.g., fertility awareness-based methods, periodic abstinence), withdrawal and other traditional methods not reported separately.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Unmet need for family planning is defined as the percentage of women of reproductive age who want to stop or delay childbearing but are not using any method of contraception.\u00a0The standard definition of unmet need for family planning includes women who are fecund and sexually active in the numerator, and who report not wanting any (more) children, or who report wanting to delay the birth of their next child for at least two years or are undecided about the timing of the next birth, but who are not using any method of contraception. The numerator also includes\u00a0pregnant women whose pregnancies were unwanted or mistimed at the time of conception; and\u00a0postpartum\u00a0amenorrhoeic\u00a0women who are not using family planning and whose last birth was unwanted or mistimed.\u00a0Further information on the operational definition of the unmet need for family planning, as well as survey questions and statistical programs needed to derive the indicator, can be found at the following website of the USAID Demographic and Health Surveys Program: <a href=\"http://measuredhs.com/Topics/Unmet-Need.cfm\">http://measuredhs.com/Topics/Unmet-Need.cfm</a> .\u00a0</p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Percent</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>GSS, GDHS Various Editions, MICS 2017</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>Ghana statistical service</p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<p>Ghana statistical service</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>The proportion of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods is useful in assessing overall levels of coverage for family planning programmes and services. Access to and use of an effective means to prevent pregnancy helps enable women and their partners to exercise their rights to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information, education and means to do so. Meeting demand for family planning with modern methods also contributes to maternal and child health by preventing unintended pregnancies and closely spaced pregnancies, which are at higher risk for poor obstetrical outcomes.</p><p>Levels of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods of 75 percent or more are generally considered high, and values of 50 percent or less are generally considered as very low. The indicator has no global numerical \u2018target\u2019 value set to be achieved by 2030. Looking at the highest values of the indicator, in 22 countries representing regions such as Europe and Northern America, Latin America and the Caribbean and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, more than 85 percent of women who want to avoid pregnancy are using a modern contraceptive method but for no country is this estimate above 91 percent.</p><p>Even in these countries, specific sub-populations (for example, adolescents or the poor) can still face barriers of access to family planning information and services. It should also be recognized that reaching 100 percent may not be a necessary or even desirable outcome with respect to reproductive rights. Some women may prefer to use a traditional method, even while having access to a full range of modern methods and being aware of the typical differences in effectiveness of methods in preventing pregnancies. Other women might have ambivalent preferences regarding their next pregnancy which may influence their contraceptive choice.</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"http://measuredhs.com/Topics/Unmet-Need.cfm\">http://measuredhs.com/Topics/Unmet-Need.cfm</a> .\u00a0</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-10-29","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-10-29: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/736e477571729aa8231126262a96bc7ab9d684a8","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.3-7-1-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.3-7-1-title","indicator_number":"3.7.1","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"indicator":"3.7.1","target_id":"3.7","sdg_goal":"3","indicator_sort_order":"03-07-01"}
