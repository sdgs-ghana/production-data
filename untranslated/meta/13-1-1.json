Among the global targets, \u201cTarget A: Substantially reduce global disaster mortality by 2030, aiming to lower average per 100,000 global mortality between 2020-2030 compared with 2005-2015\u201d and \u201cTarget B: Substantially reduce the number of affected people globally by 2030, aiming to lower the average global figure per 100,000 between 2020-2030 compared with 2005-2015\u201d will contribute to sustainable development and strengthen economic, social, health and environmental resilience. The economic, environmental and social perspectives would include poverty eradication, urban resilience, and climate change adaptation. The open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to disaster risk reduction (OIEWG) established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) has developed a set of indicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework, which was endorsed by the UNGA (OIEWG report A/71/644). The relevant global indicators for the Sendai Framework will be used to report for this indicator. Disaster loss data is greatly influenced by large-scale catastrophic events, which represent important outliers. UNISDR recommends countries report the data by event, so that complementary analysis can be undertaken to obtain trends and patterns in which such catastrophic events (that can represent outliers) can be included or excluded.</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>Related indicators as of February 2020 </p><p> </p><p>=[(A<sub>2 </sub>+A <sub>3 </sub>+B <sub>1</sub>)/ Total population ] * 100,000</p><p>Where: </p><p>A<sub>2 </sub> Number of deaths attributed to disasters;  </p><p>A<sub>3 </sub>Number of missing persons attributed to disasters </p><p>B<sub>1</sub> Number of directly affected people attributed to disasters</p><p> </p><p>* Detailed methodologies can be found in the Technical Guidance (see below the Reference section) </p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p>Official SDG Metadata URL: https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-05-01.pdf</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-07","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-11-07: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/3ff0a6a567d3052e41dc08f015db36801af586e0","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Per 100,000 population","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.13-1-1-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.13-1-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.13-1-title","indicator_number":"13.1.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Office for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-13-01-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 224 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"National Disaster Management Organisation (NADMO)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2017,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":null,"source_url_text_1":null,"source_release_date_1":null,"source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Non-official","source_contact_1":"Research@WorldBank.org","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"13.1.1","target_id":"13.1","sdg_goal":"13","indicator_sort_order":"13-01-01"}
