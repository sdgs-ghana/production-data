Unpaid domestic and care work refers to activities related to the provision of services for own final use by household members, or by family members living in other households. These activities are listed in <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/timeuse/23012019%20ICATUS.pdf\">ICATUS 2016</a> under the major divisions \u201c3.

In addition, it also provides an assessment of gender equality, by highlighting discrepancies between how much time women and men spend on unpaid work, like cooking, cleaning or taking care of children. This indicator measures the average amount of time as a proportion in a day, so that if it is reported that women aged 15+ spend 10% of their day on unpaid domestic chores while men in the same age group spend 1%, it indicates that women spend 2.4 hours (2 hours and 24 minutes), while men spend 14.4 minutes on it a day, on average. </p>","COVERAGE":"<p>This data is disaggregated  by sex, urban and rural areas.</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-11-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/1c9975a729a6932f8a8f03b468630c103f11b5fa","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Minute(s)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":["SEX","AGE","URBANISATION"],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Average time spent on unpaid domestic and care work, by sex, age and location","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_name":"global_indicators.5-4-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.5-4-title","indicator_number":"5.4.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"UN Statistics Division (UNSD)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-05-04-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 337 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":"Proxy","source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_1":"","source_earliest_available_1":2013,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www.statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/fileUpload/Living%20conditions/GLSS6_Main%20Report.pdf","source_url_text_1":"Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS), 2014","source_release_date_1":"August, 2014","source_next_release_1":"","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"5.4.1","target_id":"5.4","sdg_goal":"5","indicator_sort_order":"05-04-01"}
