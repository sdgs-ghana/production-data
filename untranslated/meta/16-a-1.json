Compliance with the Paris Principles vest NHRIs with a broad mandate, competence and power to investigate, report on the national human rights situation, and publicize human rights through information and education. While NHRIs are essentially state funded, they are to maintain independence and pluralism. These fundamental functions that NHRIs play and their increasing participation in the international human rights fora make them important actors in the improvement of the human rights situation, including the elimination of discriminatory laws and the promotion and enforcement of non-discriminatory laws. At the national level reporting, the better the accreditation classification of the NHRI reflects that it is credible, legitimate, relevant and effective in promoting human rights at the national level.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>This data is disaggregated by category.</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-11","composite_breakdown_label":"Category","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.16-a-1-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.16-a-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.16-a-title","indicator_number":"16.a.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-16-0A-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 224 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://chraj.gov.gh/annual-reports/","source_url_text_1":"CHRAJ ANNUAL REPORT","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@chraj.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"target_number":"16.a","goal_number":"16","indicator_sort_order":"16-0a-01"}
