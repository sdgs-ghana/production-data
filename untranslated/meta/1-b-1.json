However, the two indicators measures different aspects of public policies: while the Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicator is an exact measure of the distributional impact of fiscal policies aimed at achieving greater equality (SDG target 10.4), this indicator focuses solely on the spending side of governments\u2019 fiscal policies and its effect on the poor. Fiscal policies that are found to reduce overall inequality may not benefit disproportionately more the poor, as their impact on the income distribution may occur in higher deciles of the distribution. In clear contrast to the indicator Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy, the clear focus of the proposed indicator Pro-poor public social spending is on the effect of spending for poor individuals or households, reflecting if social policies are designed with pro-poor development strategies in mind, and therefore directly measuring SDG target 1.b.</p>","SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES":"<p>UNICEF, Save the Children</p>","CONTACT_ORGANISATION":"<p>Ministry of Health, Ministry of Energy</p>","STAT_CONC_DEF":"<p>Definition:</p><p>Proportion of government spending towards health and education and direct transfers which benefit directly the monetary poor.

Pro-poor social spending is defined if the proportion of government expenditures on social services is higher than the proportion of the population, measured at the level determined by national definition of income/consumption poverty (consistent with SDG 1.2.1). For instance, if the proportion of public spending received by the poor exceeds (falls below) the proportion of poor as defined by national definitions, public expenditures can be interpreted as pro-poor (not pro-poor). This is a strong measurement of the financial commitment governments make to target their services and transfers on the poor groups of society, reinforcing pro-poor development strategies. </p><p>Further developments of the methodology and improvements in data availability may allow to expand this indicator to other vulnerable groups, such as women and children</p>","REC_USE_LIM":"<p>Feasibility: The indicator can be estimated for any country for which (a) a micro-data set detailing incomes or expenditures and services utilization (i.e. education, health, and cash transfers receipts) at the individual or household level exists and (b) a set of fiscal, administrative, or budgetary records detailing public expenditures at the program level is available.</p><p>Suitability/relevance: The indicator provides an estimate how well public resources are allocated to sectors which disproportionally benefit the poor. This reflects the financial consequences of policy frameworks, which are based on pro-poor development strategies, which allows to measure progress on the SDG target 1.b.</p><p>Relationship with other SDGs: The indicator could be compared with the one under SDG 10 on equity of fiscal policy. Countries should be encouraged to collect and analyse the data within a single process to create synergy and avoid unnecessary duplication.</p><p>Limitations: The indicator does not take into effect the consequences of revenue-related fiscal activities, such as taxes or contributions to public insurance systems, on the poor. The proposed methodology does not currently expand to other groups, such as women or children. </p>","COVERAGE":"<p>The data does not have a disaggregation</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/\">SDG Indicators \u2014 SDG Indicators (un.org)</a></p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-10-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-10-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/999e04a95bda4aa30b6b71384e6445230c2e1b5f","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percent","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.1-b-1-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.1-b-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.1-b-title","indicator_number":"1.b.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-0b-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2004,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://mofep.gov.gh/index.php/publications/budget-statements","source_url_text_1":"The National Budget","source_release_date_1":"28/05/2020","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@mofep.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"1.b.1","target_id":"1.b","sdg_goal":"1","indicator_sort_order":"01-0b-01"}
