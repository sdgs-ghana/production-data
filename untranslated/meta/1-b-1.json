Pro-poor social spending is defined if the proportion of government expenditures on social services is higher than the proportion of the population, measured at the level determined by national definition of income/consumption poverty (consistent with SDG 1.2.1). For instance, if the proportion of public spending received by the poor exceeds (falls below) the proportion of poor as defined by national definitions, public expenditures can be interpreted as pro-poor (not pro-poor). This is a strong measurement of the financial commitment governments make to target their services and transfers on the poor groups of society, reinforcing pro-poor development strategies. </p><p>Further developments of the methodology and improvements in data availability may allow to expand this indicator to other vulnerable groups, such as women and children</p>","REC_USE_LIM":"<p>Feasibility: The indicator can be estimated for any country for which (a) a micro-data set detailing incomes or expenditures and services utilization (i.e. education, health, and cash transfers receipts) at the individual or household level exists and (b) a set of fiscal, administrative, or budgetary records detailing public expenditures at the program level is available.</p><p>Suitability/relevance: The indicator provides an estimate how well public resources are allocated to sectors which disproportionally benefit the poor. This reflects the financial consequences of policy frameworks, which are based on pro-poor development strategies, which allows to measure progress on the SDG target 1.b.</p><p>Relationship with other SDGs: The indicator could be compared with the one under SDG 10 on equity of fiscal policy. Countries should be encouraged to collect and analyse the data within a single process to create synergy and avoid unnecessary duplication.</p><p>Limitations: The indicator does not take into effect the consequences of revenue-related fiscal activities, such as taxes or contributions to public insurance systems, on the poor. The proposed methodology does not currently expand to other groups, such as women or children. </p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-10-28","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-10-28: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/3fedec576f77cf86f96c9fdb5aa61f2c346017a2","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.1-b-1-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.1-b-1-title","indicator_number":"1.b.1","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"indicator":"1.b.1","target_id":"1.b","sdg_goal":"1","indicator_sort_order":"01-0b-01"}
