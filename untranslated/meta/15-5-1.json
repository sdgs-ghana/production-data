The Red List Index value ranges from 1 (all species are categorized as \u2018Least Concern\u2019) to 0 (all species are categorized as \u2018Extinct\u2019), and so indicates how far the set of species has moved overall towards extinction. An upward global Red List Index trend would indicate that the SDG Target 15.5 of reducing the degradation of natural habitats and protecting threatened species is on track. A global Red List Index value of 1 would indicate that biodiversity loss has been halted. </p>","COVERAGE":"<p>There is no available disaggregation for this indicator.</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/3UTNwdh\">http://bit.ly/3UTNwdh</a> </p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-15","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Index","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.15-5-1-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.15-5-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.15-5-title","indicator_number":"15.5.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), BirdLife International (BLI)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-15-05-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 440 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Forestry Commission of Ghana (FC)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2016,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://ndpc.gov.gh/media/2020_SDGs_Report-Final.pdf","source_url_text_1":"Ghana's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Report 2020","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"","source_statistical_classification_1":"","source_contact_1":"info.tidd@fcghana.org","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"target_number":"15.5","goal_number":"15","indicator_sort_order":"15-05-01"}
