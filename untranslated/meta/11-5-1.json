Two key targets of the framework are:</p><p> (i) To substantially reduce global disaster mortality by 2030, aiming to lower the average global figure per 100,000 global mortality between 2020 and 2030 compared with 2005-2015\u201d and </p><p>(ii) To substantially reduce the number of affected people globally by 2030, aiming to lower the average global figure per 100,000 between 2020 and 2030 compared with 2005-2015\u201d.</p><p>Meeting the targets will contribute to sustainable development and strengthen economic, social, health and environmental resilience.
