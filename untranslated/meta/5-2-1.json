Given prevailing social norms that sanction male dominance over women, male violence towards their female intimate partners is often perceived as an ordinary/normal element of relationships in the context of marriage or other unions/relationships. Violence against women is an extreme manifestation of gender inequality and discrimination. Prevalence data are required to measure the magnitude of the problem; understand the various forms of violence and their consequences; identify groups at high risk and explore the barriers to seeking help to ensure that the appropriate responses are being provided. These data are the starting point for informing laws, policies and developing effective responses and prevention programs. </p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/48/104\">https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/48/104</a> </p><p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/docs/guidelines_statistics_vaw.pdf\">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/docs/guidelines_statistics_vaw.pdf</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/crime/ICCS/ICCS_English_2016_web.pdf)\">https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/crime/ICCS/ICCS_English_2016_web.pdf)</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240022256\">https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240022256</a></p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-12","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-11-12: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/2342712dc6e94048d5534b7c21a28bc958ffcb29","composite_breakdown_label":"Form of Violence","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.5-2-1-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_name":"global_indicators.5-2-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.5-2-title","indicator_number":"5.2.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), The United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-05-02-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 518 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"National Development Planning Commission (NDPC)","source_periodicity_1":"","source_earliest_available_1":"","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-ndpc-static1/CACHES/PUBLICATIONS/2018/08/23/Medium-term+Policy+Framework-Final+June+2018.pdf","source_url_text_1":"Annual Progress Report on the Implementation of Medium Term National Development Policy Framework (MTNDPF), 2018","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@ndpc.gov.gh","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_2":"","source_earliest_available_2":"","source_geographical_coverage_2":"Ghana","source_url_2":"https://www.statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/fileUpload/pressrelease/GLSS7%20MAIN%20REPORT_FINAL.pdf","source_url_text_2":"Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS), round 7, 2019","source_release_date_2":"June, 2019","source_next_release_2":"","source_statistical_classification_2":"Official","source_contact_2":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"5.2.1","target_id":"5.2","sdg_goal":"5","indicator_sort_order":"05-02-01"}
