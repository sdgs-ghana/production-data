For countries with Marine/Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) in place, these plans can be helpful to assess ICZM. For other countries, it is important to identify ways to measure existing plans and to build capacity for integrated planning. All data for this indicator will be based on country submissions to the Regional Seas Programme. In order to promote the use of the Regional Seas as part of the follow-up and review mechanism for the Regional Seas, UNEP drafted report on how Regional Seas data could be directly used for the SDGs (see https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/27295/ocean_SDG.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowe d=y). Plans are developed through coordination across different marine and terrestrial institutions and agencies. Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) \u2013 Marine Spatial Planning is focused on the EEZ. It then integrates the needs and policies of multiple marine sectors in one coherent planning framework. EEZ - national Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (200 nautical miles from the coast) as outlined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>Tides database</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>Ocean Conservancy</p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<p>Ghana Statistical Service</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>From an ecological perspective, ecosystem approaches consider the connections between the living organisms, habitats, physical and chemical conditions within an ecosystem, focusing on the importance of ecological integrity, biodiversity and overall ecosystem health. From a management perspective, ecosystem-based approaches refer to integrated management strategies for socio-ecological systems that consider ecological, social and economic factors and apply principles of sustainable development. A marine or coastal area-based (or spatial) management promotes better management of EEZs. Many countries use Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) and Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) as their approach for ensuring appropriate ecosystem-based management, including issues that are crosssectoral and wider scale in nature.</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-10-15","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-10-15: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/f886dc2df9b13ebd79ddb35590500e544b5c8a3d","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.14-2-1-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.14-2-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.14-2-title","indicator_number":"14.2.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-14-02-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 436 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"notstarted","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"World Bank","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2004,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY?locations=GB","source_url_text_1":"Poverty headcount ratio at $1.90 a day (2011 PPP) (% of population)","source_release_date_1":"28/05/2020","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Non-official","source_contact_1":"Research@WorldBank.org","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"14.2.1","target_id":"14.2","sdg_goal":"14","indicator_sort_order":"14-02-01"}
