The unit of analysis could be either the individual or the household. The individuals or households are considered as multidimensionally poor if they are deprived in multiple dimensions, exceeding certain thresholds.</p><p>EU countries, North Macedonia and Turkey have a different approach to measure the multidimensional poverty using the concept of \"people at risk of poverty or social exclusion\" (AROPE) calculated by EUROSTAT using the data from EU statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC). AROPE consists of three indicators, and individuals are considered as \"at risk of poverty or social exclusion\" if they are \"at risk of poverty\" or \"severely materially deprived\" or \"living in a household with a very low work intensity\".</p><p>There is a multidimensional poverty measure specifically designed for children. A child is considered multidimensionally poor if s/he is simultaneously deprived in multiple dimensions. It identifies the dimensions of poverty and the indicators under each dimension, and has a similar structure to the AF methodology. However, it is different in that it focuses on the life-cycle of children, creating different sets of dimensions and indicators for different age groups (e.g., for ages 0-4, 5-11, 12-14, 15-17 years), and conducts analyses separately for each age group. In the global SDG database, the multidimensional poverty headcount (%) for the overall 0-17 age group has been used for countries reporting individual measures of child multidimensional poverty.</p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Percentage</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>Multidimensional child Poverty in Ghana, 2020)</p><p>Multidimensional poverty, Ghana living standards survey, Ghana Multiple indicator Cluster survey \u2013 Ghana statistical service.<br/></p>","COLL_METHOD":"<p>Survey and primary sourced data</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>Ghana Statistical service</p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<p>Ghana Statistical service</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>Poverty has traditionally been defined as the lack of money. However, the poor themselves consider their experience of poverty much more broadly. A person who is poor can suffer multiple disadvantages at the same time \u2013 for example, they may have poor health or malnutrition, a lack of clean water or electricity, poor quality of work or little schooling. Focusing on one factor alone, such as income, is not enough to capture the true reality of poverty. Therefore, multidimensional poverty measures described above have been developed to create a more comprehensive picture by looking at multiple dimensions such as health,</p><p>education, living standards. Official multidimensional poverty headcount (% population), official multidimensional poverty headcount (% of total households) and multidimensional deprivation for children (% of population under 18) are all about the headcount ratio trying to capture how many people, households, or children in the entire pool are regarded as multidimensionally poor. On the other hand, average share of weighted deprivation tries to capture the depth of multidimensional poverty. For instance, if there are 18 indicators to capture different dimensions of poverty, the person who is deprived in 5 indicators, and the person who is deprived in 15 indicators are considered to be both multidimensionally poor. However, the 'intensity' of the poverty is different between these two people, which is captured by the average share of weighted deprivation.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>Data has been disaggregated into urban and rural areas, regions and development dimensions </p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p>Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, poverty Rate 2022</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-10-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-10-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/999e04a95bda4aa30b6b71384e6445230c2e1b5f","composite_breakdown_label":"Development Dimensions","computation_units":"Percent","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":["URBANISATION","AGE"],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.1-2-2-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_name":"global_indicators.1-2-2-title","target_name":"global_targets.1-2-title","indicator_number":"1.2.2","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEFF), World Bank (WB), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-02-02.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 894 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ghana Statistical Service","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2020,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www.statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/fileUpload/pressrelease/Multidimensional%20Poverty%20Ghana_Report.pdf","source_url_text_1":"Multidimensional Poverty Report, Ghana 2020","source_release_date_1":"May 2020","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"1.2.2","target_id":"1.2","sdg_goal":"1","indicator_sort_order":"01-02-02"}
