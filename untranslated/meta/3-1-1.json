It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live births and essentially captures the risk of death in a single pregnancy or a single live birth. Maternal deaths: The annual number of female deaths from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, expressed per 100,000 live births, for a specified time period.</p><p>1) Institutional maternal mortality number of maternal deaths occurring in health facilities per 100, 000 live births, the estimate from survey represents on maternal deaths occurrences recorded at health facilities and other per 100,000 live births. </p><p>2) Maternal mortality ratio (from survey) is the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Maternal deaths are any deaths that occurs during pregnancy or childbirth or within 42 days after the birth of a child or termination of pregnancy.

Both point-estimates and 80% UIs should be taken into account when<br/>assessing estimates.<br/>For example: \u201cThe estimated 2017 global MMR is 211 (UI 199 to 243).\u201d<br/>This means:<br/>\u2022 The point-estimate is 211 and the 80% uncertainty interval ranges 199 to 243.<br/>\u2022 There is a 50% chance that the true 2017 global MMR lies above 211, and a 50% chance that the<br/>true value lies below 211.<br/>\u2022 There is an 80% chance that the true 2017 global MMR lies between 199 and 243.<br/>\u2022 There is still a 10% chance that the true 2017 global MMR lies above 243, and a 10% chance that<br/>the true value lies below 199.<br/>Other accurate interpretations include:<br/>\u2022 We are 90% certain that the true 2017 global MMR is at least 199.<br/>\u2022 We are 90% certain that the true 2017 global MMR is 243 or less.</p><p>The amount of data available for estimating an indicator and the quality of that data determine the width<br/>of an indicator\u2019s UI.
