A low completion rate indicates low or delayed entry into a given level of education, high drop-out, high repetition, late completion, or a combination of these factors.</p><p>The completion rate can be used either as a self-standing indicator or in combination with SDG indicator 4.1.1 (proportion of children and young people (a) in Grade 2 or 3; (b) at the end of primary education; and (c) at the end of lower secondary education achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics). Combining the completion rate with indicator 4.1.1 provides information on the percentage of children or young people in a cohort who achieve a minimum level of proficiency, and not only on the percentage of children in school who achieve minimum proficiency.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>The data has been disaggregated into educational levels</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/\">SDG Indicators \u2014 SDG Indicators (un.org)</a></p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-11-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/ce9c64c8400853fa16cdce8a8e68e5330d9f6328","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.4-1-2-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.4-1-2-title","target_name":"global_targets.4-1-title","indicator_number":"4.1.2","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"UNESCO Institute for Statistics","goal_meta_link":"Metadata-04-01-02.pdf (un.org)","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata 4.1.2","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Education","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":"","source_geographical_coverage_1":"","source_url_1":"https://moe.gov.gh/emis/","source_url_text_1":"EMIS Data Centre, Ministry of Education","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"pro@moe.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"4.1.2","target_id":"4.1","sdg_goal":"4","indicator_sort_order":"04-01-02"}
