Main sectors, as defined by ISIC standards, include agriculture; forestry and fishing; manufacturing; electricity industry; and services. This indicator is also known as water withdrawal intensity.</p><p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p><p>This indicator provides an estimate of pressure by all sectors on the country\u2019s renewable freshwater resources. A low level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors is marginal in relation to the resources, and has therefore little potential impact on the sustainability of the resources or on the potential competition between users. A high level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors represents a substantial share of the total renewable freshwater resources, with potentially larger impacts on the sustainability of the resources and potential situations of conflicts and competition between users. </p><p>Total renewable freshwater resources (TRWR) are expressed as the sum of internal and external renewable water resources. The terms \u201cwater resources\u201d and \u201cwater withdrawal\u201d are understood here as freshwater resources and freshwater withdrawal. </p><p>Internal renewable water resources are defined as the long-term average annual flow of rivers and recharge of groundwater for a given country generated from endogenous precipitation. </p><p>External renewable water resources refer to the flows of water entering the country, taking into consideration the quantity of flows reserved to upstream and downstream countries through agreements or treaties. </p><p>Total freshwater withdrawal (TFWW) is the volume of freshwater extracted from its source (rivers, lakes, aquifers) for agriculture, industries and services<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[2]</a></sup>. It is estimated at the country level for the following three main sectors: agriculture, services (including domestic water withdrawal) and industries (including cooling of thermoelectric plants). Freshwater withdrawal includes fossil groundwater. It does not include non-conventional water, i.e. direct use of treated wastewater, direct use of agricultural drainage water and desalinated water. </p><p>Environmental flow requirements (EFR) are defined as the quantity and timing of freshwater flows and levels necessary to sustain aquatic ecosystems, which, in turn, support human cultures, economies, sustainable livelihoods, and wellbeing.  Water quality and also the resulting ecosystem services are excluded from this formulation which is confined to water volumes. This does not imply that quality and the support to societies which are dependent on environmental flows are not important and should not be taken care of.<sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[3]</a></sup> Methods of computation of EFR are extremely variable and range from global estimates to comprehensive assessments for river reaches. For the purpose of the SDG indicator, water volumes can be expressed in the same units as the TFWW, and then as percentages of the available water resources.</p><div class=\"footnotes\"><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-2\">2</sup><p> <a href=\"#footnote-ref-2\">\u2191</a></p></div><div><sup class=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-3\">3</sup><p> <a href=\"#footnote-ref-3\">\u2191</a></p></div></div>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Percentage</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>2020 Annual Report, WRC</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>Water Resources Commission (WRC)</p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<p>Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>The purpose of this indicator is to show the degree to which water resources are being exploited to meet the country's water demand. It measures a country's pressure on its water resources and therefore the challenge on the sustainability of its water use. It tracks progress regarding \u201cwithdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity\u201d, i.e. the environmental component of target 6.4. The indicator shows to what extent water resources are already used, and signals the importance of effective supply and demand management policies. It indicates the likelihood of increasing competition and conflict between different water uses and users in a situation of increasing water scarcity. Increased water stress, shown by an increase in the value of the indicator, has potentially negative effects on the sustainability of the natural resources and on economic development. On the other hand, low values of the indicator indicate that water does not represent a particular challenge for economic development and sustainability. This indicator provides an estimate of pressure by all sectors on Ghana\u2019s renewable freshwater resources. A low level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors is marginal in relation to the resources, and has therefore little potential impact on the sustainability of the resources or on the potential competition between users. A high level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors represents a substantial share of the total renewable freshwater resources, with potentially larger impacts on the sustainability of the resources and potential situations of conflicts and competition between users.</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-10-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-10-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/999e04a95bda4aa30b6b71384e6445230c2e1b5f","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"m3/per person/year","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.6-4-2-title","graph_titles":[{"series":"Per capita share of raw water (m3/per person/year)","title":"Per capita share of raw water (m3/per person/year)"}],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.6-4-2-title","target_name":"global_targets.6-4-title","indicator_number":"6.4.2","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-06-04-02.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 615 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"World Bank","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2004,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY?locations=GB","source_url_text_1":"Poverty headcount ratio at $1.90 a day (2011 PPP) (% of population)","source_release_date_1":"28/05/2020","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Non-official","source_contact_1":"Research@WorldBank.org","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"6.4.2","target_id":"6.4","sdg_goal":"6","indicator_sort_order":"06-04-02"}
