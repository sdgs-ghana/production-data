It measures a country's pressure on its water resources and therefore the challenge on the sustainability of its water use. The indicator shows to what extent water resources are already used, and signals the importance of effective supply and demand management policies. This indicator provides an estimate of pressure by all sectors on Ghana\u2019s renewable freshwater resources.
