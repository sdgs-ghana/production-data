As the conservation and</p><p>accessibility to these resources is of vital importance, medium or long term conservation facilities</p><p>(genebanks) to preserve and make accessible these resources and its associated information for</p><p>breeding and research have been established at country, regional and global levels. Inventories of</p><p>genebank holdings provide a dynamic measure of the existing plant and animal diversity and its</p><p>level of preservation. Data relevant to this indicator facilitate the monitoring of diversity secured</p><p>and accessible through genebanks and support the development and updating of strategies for the</p><p>conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources.</p><p>The indicator is related to a monitoring framework endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic</p><p>Resources for Food and Agriculture in which the status and trends of plant and animal genetic</p><p>resources are described through globally agreed indicators and regular country-driven assessments.</p><p>The number of materials conserved under medium or long term storage conditions provides an</p><p>indirect measurement of the total genetic diversity which we are managing to secure for future</p><p>use. Overall, positive variations are therefore approximated to an increase in the agro-biodiversity</p><p>secured, while negative variations to a loss of it.</p><p>Caution needs to be paid in interpreting the indicator. In the case of plant genetic resources, an</p><p>uncontrolled addition of accessions which in fact are duplicates of samples already conserved and</p><p>accounted for, or, <em>viceversa</em>, the deletion from the reported collections of redundant duplicates may</p><p>lead to wrong interpretations. Another example that needs to be monitored both while reporting and interpreting the results include the grouping or splitting of accessions, as in both cases the</p><p>variation in the accounted number does not reflect a variation in the genetic diversity conserved</p><p>and secured. Therefore, it is crucial that reporting countries and stakeholders together with the</p><p>accession level information requested explain also the reason for the decrease or increase in the</p><p>number of accessions when this does not reflect a real loss or gain in the genetic diversity conserved</p><p>and secured. reflected in the number of accessions, contributing to an overestimate of the actual number of accessions.
