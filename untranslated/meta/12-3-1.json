What is considered inedible varies among users (e.g., chicken feet are consumed in some food supply chains but not others), changes over time, and is influenced by a range of variables including culture, socio-economic factors, availability, price, technological advances, international trade and geography.</p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Percentage (%)</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p> Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA) Annual Progress Report,  2019</p>","FREQ_COLL":"<p>Annual</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA)</p>","RATIONALE":"<p><a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/programmes/un-2030-agenda&quot; \\l &quot;:~:text=The%202030%20Agenda%20for%20Sustainable,equality%20and%20non%2Ddiscrimination%E2%80%9D.\">The 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda</a> has emphasized the importance of sustainable production and consumption systems as efficient food systems, on the supply side and the consumption side, contribute to food security and sustainability of natural resource since agriculture is a major user of land and water. The food loss and food waste index look at the entire supply chain and the trend in structural losses. The Food Loss Index monitors progress on the supply side of food chains, as it measures if the share of agriculture production that does not reach the retail stage in 2030 has increased or decreased with respect to the base period and by how much. The numerator of the indicator indicates the level of losses and informs on the magnitude of the problem. A greater efficiency of the food supply chain also has implications for all producers whether looking at efficiency in large-scale producers for export markets or in small-scale production units relevant for poverty and food insecurity reduction goal.</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>Total post harvest losses divided by total production, multiplied by 100</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>This data is disaggregated by type of produce.</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/\">SDG Indicators \u2014 SDG Indicators (un.org)</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/cb2949en/cb2949en.pdf\">https://www.fao.org/3/cb2949en/cb2949en.pdf</a> </p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-11-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/afc3fbd37261e52011d57615ad3feb2abb4d4298","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Post-harvest losses for selected produce","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.12-3-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.12-3-title","indicator_number":"12.3.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), UN Environment (UNEP)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/tierIII-indicators/files/Tier3-12-03-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 4.0 MB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2010,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://mofa.gov.gh/site/publications/research-reports","source_url_text_1":"Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA) Annual Progress Report, 2019","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"ghanacares.agric@mofa.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"12.3.1","target_id":"12.3","sdg_goal":"12","indicator_sort_order":"12-03-01"}
