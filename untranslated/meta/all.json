It is motivated by the need for an indicator that is easy to understand, communicate, and measure\u2014though measurement challenges exist. </p>","COVERAGE":"<p>There is no available disaggregation for this indicator. </p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-09","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-11-09: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/22d75188518052e48ea05bcca7569e23d45f2291","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.10-1-1-title","graph_titles":[{"series":"Expenditure share of the bottom 40 percent of the population","title":"Expenditure share of the bottom 40 percent of the population"}],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.10-1-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.10-1-title","indicator_number":"10.1.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"World Bank (WB)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-10-01-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 221 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2013,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www.statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/fileUpload/pressrelease/GLSS7%20MAIN%20REPORT_FINAL.pdf","source_url_text_1":"Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS)","source_release_date_1":"June, 2019","source_next_release_1":"","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"10.1.1","target_id":"10.1","sdg_goal":"10","indicator_sort_order":"10-01-01"},"10-3-1":{"SDG_GOAL":"<p>Goal 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries</p>","SDG_TARGET":"<p>Target 10.3: Ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome, including by eliminating discriminatory laws, policies and practices and promoting appropriate legislation, policies and action in this regard</p>","SDG_INDICATOR":"<p>Indicator 10.3.1: Proportion of population reporting having personally felt discriminated against or harassed in the previous 12 months on the basis of a ground of discrimination prohibited under international human rights law</p>","SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS":"<p>5.1.1</p><p>16.1.3 </p><p>16.a.1</p><p>16.6.2 </p>","SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES":"<p>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)</p>","STAT_CONC_DEF":"<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p><p>This indicator is defined as the proportion of the population (adults) who self-report that they personally experienced discrimination or harassment during the last 12 months based on ground(s) prohibited by international human rights law.

The share of labour compensation in national output can highlight the extent to which economic growth translates into higher incomes for employees over time (and/or higher earnings for the self-employed). In periods of economic recession, the labour income share provides an indication of the extent to which falling output reduces labour income relative to profits. If labour income falls at a greater rate than profits, the labour income share will be expected to fall. By contrast, if there is a sharper decline in profits than in labour income, the share will rise. For any given level of GDP and profits, the labour income share can fall as a result of falling wages, falling earnings of the self-employed, changes in the composition of employment by income or a combination of these. Increased production and GDP often lead to improved living standards of individuals in the economy, but this will depend on the distribution of real income and public policy among other factors.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>There is no available disaggregation for this indicator.</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-13","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-11-13: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/d8b921114b9af597ee6e2c02758b2beffdf09cfe","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.10-4-1-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.10-4-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.10-4-title","indicator_number":"10.4.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"International Labour Organization (ILO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-10-04-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 190 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_1":"","source_earliest_available_1":2014,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www2.statsghana.gov.gh/docfiles/glss6/GLSS6_Labour%20Force%20Report.pdf","source_url_text_1":"Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS) Round 6 Labour Force Report, 2014","source_release_date_1":"August, 2014","source_next_release_1":"","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_2":"","source_earliest_available_2":"","source_geographical_coverage_2":"Ghana","source_url_2":"https://www.statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/fileUpload/pressrelease/GLSS7%20MAIN%20REPORT_FINAL.pdf","source_url_text_2":"Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS) Round 7, 2017","source_release_date_2":"June, 2019","source_next_release_2":"","source_statistical_classification_2":"Official","source_contact_2":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"10.4.1","target_id":"10.4","sdg_goal":"10","indicator_sort_order":"10-04-01"},"10-7-1":{"SDG_GOAL":"<p>Goal 10: Reduced inequality within and among countries</p>","SDG_TARGET":"<p>Target 10.7: Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies</p>","SDG_INDICATOR":"<p>Indicator 10.7.1: Recruitment cost borne by employee as a proportion of monthly income earned in country of destination</p>","SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES":"<p>International Labour Organization (ILO)</p>","STAT_CONC_DEF":"<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p><p>Recruitment costs refer to \u201cany fees or costs incurred in the recruitment process in order for workers to secure employment or placement, regardless of the manner, timing or location of their imposition or collection.</p><p>Recruitment Cost Indicator (RCI) is defined as the number of months it would take for a migrant worker to offset the recruitment cost incurred as a result of migrating to another country to work.</p><p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p><p>A household is defined as \u201cone person or a group of persons who live together, share the same house-keeping arrangements, and recognize one person as the head of household\u201d.

These data are the starting point for informing laws, policies and developing effective responses and prevention programs. </p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/48/104\">https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/48/104</a>  </p><p><a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/docs/guidelines_statistics_vaw.pdf\">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/docs/guidelines_statistics_vaw.pdf</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240022256\">https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240022256</a> </p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-14","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-11-14: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/823078c007bc43162041ecf534a54734fb16a87d","composite_breakdown_label":"Form of Violence","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.5-2-1-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_name":"global_indicators.5-2-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.5-2-title","indicator_number":"5.2.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), The United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-05-02-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 518 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"National Development Planning Commission (NDPC)","source_periodicity_1":"","source_earliest_available_1":"","source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/new-ndpc-static1/CACHES/PUBLICATIONS/2018/08/23/Medium-term+Policy+Framework-Final+June+2018.pdf","source_url_text_1":"Annual Progress Report on the Implementation of Medium Term National Development Policy Framework (MTNDPF), 2018","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@ndpc.gov.gh","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_2":"","source_earliest_available_2":"","source_geographical_coverage_2":"Ghana","source_url_2":"https://www.statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/fileUpload/pressrelease/GLSS7%20MAIN%20REPORT_FINAL.pdf","source_url_text_2":"Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS), round 7, 2019","source_release_date_2":"June, 2019","source_next_release_2":"","source_statistical_classification_2":"Official","source_contact_2":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"5.2.1","target_id":"5.2","sdg_goal":"5","indicator_sort_order":"05-02-01"},"5-3-1":{"SDG_GOAL":"<p>Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls</p>","SDG_TARGET":"<p>Target 5.3: Eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation</p>","SDG_INDICATOR":"<p>Indicator 5.3.1: Proportion of women aged 20-24 years who were married or in a union before age 15 and age 18</p>","SDG_SERIES_DESCR":"<p>Proportion of women aged 20-24 years who were married or in a union before age 15 [5.3.1]</p><p>Proportion of women aged 20-24 years who were married or in union before age 18 [5.3.1]</p>","SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES":"<p>United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)</p>","STAT_CONC_DEF":"<p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p><p>Both formal (i.e., marriages) and informal unions are covered under this indicator.

Equal numbers of women and men in lower chambers would give an indicator value of 50 percent. A stronger presence of women in parliament allows new concerns to be highlighted on political agendas, and new priorities to be put into practice through the adoption and implementation of policies and laws. The inclusion of the perspectives and interests of women is a prerequisite for democracy and gender equality, and contributes to good governance. A representative parliament also allows the different experiences of men and women to affect the social, political and economic future of societies. Although the international community has supported and promoted women\u2019s participation in political decision-making structures for several decades, improvement in women\u2019s access to parliament has been slow.

To efficiently curb IUU fishing a number of different international instruments have been developed over the years that focus on the implementation of the different responsibilities of States.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>There is no available disaggregation for this indicator.</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-11-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/eba7d57367b41d5566099d0f39272c42b1a73d37","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Band","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.14-6-1-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_name":"global_indicators.14-6-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.14-6-title","indicator_number":"14.6.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-14-06-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 4.0 MB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)","source_periodicity_1":"","source_earliest_available_1":2018,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/faoweb/statistics/SDG/April_2022/14.6.1_Progress_in_implementation_of_international_instruments_aiming_to_combat_IUU_fishing.xlsx","source_url_text_1":"Progress in the degree of implementation of instruments to combat IUU fishing, 2018\u20132022","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official international","source_contact_1":"FAO-HQ@fao.org","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"14.6.1","target_id":"14.6","sdg_goal":"14","indicator_sort_order":"14-06-01"},"6-1-1":{"SDG_GOAL":"<p>Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all</p>","SDG_TARGET":"<p>Target 6.1: By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all</p>","SDG_INDICATOR":"<p> Indicator 6.1.1: Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services</p>","SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES":"<p>World Health Organization (WHO)</p><p>United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)</p>","STAT_CONC_DEF":"<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p><p>Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services is currently being measured by the proportion of population using an improved basic drinking water source which is located on premises, available when needed and free of fecal (and priority chemical) contamination. \u2018Improved\u2019 drinking water sources include: piped water into dwelling, yard or plot; public taps or standpipes; boreholes or tube wells; protected dug wells; protected springs; packaged water; delivered water and rainwater.</p><p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p><p>A water source is considered to be \u2018located on premises\u2019 if the point of collection is within the dwelling, yard, or plot.</p><p>\u2018Available when needed\u2019: Households are able to access sufficient quantities of water when needed.</p><p>\u2018Free from faecal and priority chemical contamination\u2019: water complies with relevant national or local standards.</p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Percentage (%)</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>World Health Organization (WHO)</p><p>United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF)</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>Access to safe drinking water is essential for good health, welfare and productivity and is widely recognized as a human right.

A high level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors represents a substantial share of the total renewable freshwater resources, with potentially larger impacts on the sustainability of the resources and potential situations of conflicts and competition between users.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>There is no available disaggregation for this indicator.</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-11-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/4d4e0510f9c0356b6c51d7ca4d6f233d44ff5281","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"m3/per person/year","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.6-4-2-title","graph_titles":[{"series":"Per capita share of raw water (m3/per person/year)","title":"Per capita share of raw water (m3/per person/year)"}],"graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.6-4-2-title","target_name":"global_targets.6-4-title","indicator_number":"6.4.2","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-06-04-02.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 615 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Water Resources Commission (WRC)","source_periodicity_1":"","source_earliest_available_1":2013,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://wrcwebsite.azurewebsites.net/mdocs-posts/wrc-annual-report-2021-22_final/","source_url_text_1":"Water Resources Commission (WRC), Annual Report, 2021/22","source_release_date_1":"","source_next_release_1":"","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"https://www.wrc-gh.org/contact-us","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"6.4.2","target_id":"6.4","sdg_goal":"6","indicator_sort_order":"06-04-02"},"6-5-1":{"SDG_GOAL":"<p>Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all</p>","SDG_TARGET":"<p>Target 6.5: By 2030, implement integrated water resources management at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate</p>","SDG_INDICATOR":"<p>Indicator 6.5.1: Degree of integrated water resources management</p>","SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES":"<p>United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)</p>","STAT_CONC_DEF":"<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p><p>It measures the stages of development and implementation of <a href=\"https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/iwrm.shtml\">Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM)</a>.</p><p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p><p>The concept of IWRM is measured in 4 main sections, each representing key dimension of IWRM:</p><p>1.

exact methodology selected, it still follows a similar process to define the features of the measure, which include: i) the purpose of the measure; ii) the unit of identification (most frequently either the household or the individuals); iii) the dimensions and respective indicators that delimit which deprivations should be measured; iv) the methodology for developing the measure (including deprivation cut-offs, weights, and poverty cut-offs).</p><p>The most commonly used method is the Alkire Foster (AF) methodology which identifies dimensions, typically health, education and living standards and several indicators in each dimension. The unit of analysis could be either the individual or the household. The individuals or households are considered as multidimensionally poor if they are deprived in multiple dimensions, exceeding certain thresholds.</p><p>There is a multidimensional poverty measure specifically designed for children. A child is considered multidimensionally poor if s/he is simultaneously deprived in multiple dimensions. It identifies the dimensions of poverty and the indicators under each dimension, and has a similar structure to the AF methodology. However, it is different in that it focuses on the life-cycle of children, creating different sets of dimensions and indicators for different age groups (e.g., for ages 0-4, 5-11, 12-14, 15-17 years), and conducts analyses separately for each age group. In the global SDG database, the multidimensional poverty headcount (%) for the overall 0-17 age group has been used for countries reporting individual measures of child multidimensional poverty.</p><p>Ghana\u2019s Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), complements the monetary poverty by providing an assessment of deprivation of basic survival needs.

However, the poor themselves consider their experience of poverty much more broadly. A person who is poor can suffer multiple disadvantages at the same time \u2013 for example, they may have poor health or malnutrition, a lack of clean water or electricity, poor quality of work or little schooling. Focusing on one factor alone, such as income, is not enough to capture the true reality of poverty. Therefore, multidimensional poverty measures described above have been developed to create a more comprehensive picture by looking at multiple dimensions such as health, education and living standards. Official multidimensional poverty headcount (% population), official multidimensional poverty headcount (% of total households) and multidimensional deprivation for children (% of population under 18) are all about the headcount ratio trying to capture how many people, households, or children in the entire pool are regarded as multidimensionally poor. On the other hand, average share of weighted deprivation tries to capture the depth of multidimensional poverty. For instance, if there are 18 indicators to capture different dimensions of poverty, the person who is deprived in 5 indicators, and the person who is deprived in 15 indicators are considered to be both multidimensionally poor. However, the 'intensity' of the poverty is different between these two people, which is captured by the average share of weighted deprivation.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>This data is disaggregated by urban and rural areas, regions and development dimensions. </p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://data.oecd.org/inequality/poverty-rate.htm\">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Poverty Rate 2022.</a></p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-03","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-11-03: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/3bf7be459bf37c6728acf8dcb46a7dea2a5abb71","composite_breakdown_label":"Development Dimensions","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":["URBANISATION","AGE"],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.1-2-2-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_name":"global_indicators.1-2-2-title","target_name":"global_targets.1-2-title","indicator_number":"1.2.2","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEFF), World Bank (WB), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-02-02.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 894 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_1":null,"source_earliest_available_1":2017,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www.statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/fileUpload/pressrelease/Multidimensional%20Poverty%20Ghana_Report.pdf","source_url_text_1":"Multidimensional Poverty Report, Ghana 2020","source_release_date_1":"May 2020","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_2":true,"source_organisation_2":"National Development Planning Committee (NDPC)","source_periodicity_2":null,"source_earliest_available_2":2017,"source_geographical_coverage_2":"Ghana","source_url_2":"https://www.unicef.org/ghana/media/2676/file/Multi-Dimensional%20Child%20Poverty%20Report.pdf","source_url_text_2":"Multidimensional Child Poverty Report, Ghana 2020","source_release_date_2":"January 2020","source_next_release_2":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_2":"Official","source_contact_2":"info@ndpc.gov.gh","source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"1.2.2","target_id":"1.2","sdg_goal":"1","indicator_sort_order":"01-02-02"},"1-3-1":{"SDG_GOAL":"<p>Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere</p>","SDG_TARGET":"<p>Target 1.3: Implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable </p>","SDG_INDICATOR":"<p>Indicator 1.3.1: Proportion of population covered by social protection floors/systems, by sex, distinguishing children, unemployed persons, older persons, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, newborns, work-injury victims and the poor and the vulnerable </p>","SDG_SERIES_DESCR":"<p>Cash transfer coverage of extremely poor households under Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) programme </p><p>Proportion of basic school students under Ghana School Feeding Programme (GSFP) </p><p>Total Beneficiaries of Free Senior High School Programme (FSHSP)</p><p>Proportion with access to affordable healthcare under National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS)</p>","SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS":"<p>3.8.1</p><p>3.8.2</p><p>1.a.2</p>","SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES":"<p>International Labour Organization (ILO)</p>","STAT_CONC_DEF":"<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p><p>The indicator reflects the proportion of persons effectively covered by a social protection system, including social protection floors.

A Social Protection Rationalization Study conducted in 2013 established the need for a holistic National Social Protection Policy. Further impetus for the policy was provided by Cabinet\u2019s approval in June, 2014 of strategic, oversight and monitoring roles of the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection, which included leading the development of such a policy. The Ministry was also required to work closely with the Ministry of Finance to ensure consistency in the flow of funds to social protection programmes and for the progressive implementation of a national social protection floor. </p><p>Ghana is undergoing transformation on several fronts including the transition to middle income country status; information and communication advancements; and increasing urbanization. The changes in community, cultural and family arrangements have implications for traditional social protection arrangements. A modern system of social protection has the potential to have significant impacts on incomes, equitable development, and increased access to social services for the extremely poor and vulnerable. There are opportunities for more responsive social development through the dialogue and social accountability that vibrant civil society organizations and an informed media can facilitate. </p><p>Ghana has various national and international commitments that make a coherent, integrated social protection framework imperative. The Fourth Republican Constitution provides a basis for social protection in the Directive Principles of State Policy. International commitments include those to the African Union (AU) to pursue comprehensive programmes of social protection as outlined in the African Union Social Policy Framework (2003), the Livingstone Declaration (2006), the Ouagadogou Declaration and Plan of Action (2004, 2008) and the AU Heads of State Common Agenda for Action Post-2015. </p><p>The National Social Protection Policy provides a framework for delivering social protection coherently, effectively and efficiently in a way that is holistic and properly targeted. It defines social protection for Ghana as \u201ca range of actions carried out by the state and other parties in response to vulnerability and poverty, which seek to guarantee relief for those sections of the population who for any reason are not able to provide for themselves\u201d. It provides an institutional framework for coordination and as well as stakeholder collaboration in monitoring and ensuring accountability. It is linked to range of legal instruments and policies that provide a framework within which the obligations to various target groups may be justified, implemented, regulated and advocated. It embraces a strategic vision of an all-inclusive and socially empowered society through the provision of sustainable mechanisms for the protection of persons living in situations of extreme poverty and related vulnerability and exclusion. It supports the principle that every Ghanaian matters and is capable of contributing to national development. It therefore aspires to close the inequality gap and ensure total inclusion for all Ghanaians. It seeks to promote the well-being of Ghanaians through an integrated platform of effective social assistance, social and productive inclusion, social services and social insurance. </p><p>The short-term focuses on being rehabilitative, restorative, protective and facilitating. This will include the implementation of five flagship programmes, namely, the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP), the Labour Intensive Public Works (LIPW), the School Feeding Programme (SFP), the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) Exemptions and the Basic Education Capitation Grants. The medium term efforts are preventive and promoting. The long-term orientation is transformation. Operationally, it proposes reforms to programming, targeting, funding, public understanding of social protection and knowledge management. The policy\u2019s strategic imperatives are coordination and complementarity; emergency assistance; social welfare and facilitation services; productive inclusion; decent work; capacity and capability building; and mainstreaming gender and disability issues in social protection. </p><p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p><p>Social protection systems include contributory and non-contributory schemes for children, pregnant women with newborns, people in active age, older persons, for victims of work injuries and persons with disabilities.

groups.</p><p>Indicator 1.4.2 covers (a) all types of land use (such as residential, commercial, agricultural, forestry, grazing, wetlands based on standard land-use classification) in both rural and urban areas; and (b) all land tenure types as recognized at the country level, such as freehold, leasehold, public land and customary land. An individual can hold land in his/her own name, jointly with other individuals, as a member of a household, or collectively as a member of a group, cooperative or other type of association.</p><p>Secure tenure rights: comprised of two sub-components: (i) legally recognized documentation and (ii) perception of the security of tenure, which are both necessary to provide a full measurement of tenure security.</p><p>Legally recognized documentation: Legal documentation of rights refers to the recording and publication of information on the nature and location of land, rights and right holders in a form that is recognized by government, and is therefore official. For purposes of computing SDG Indicator 1.4.2, the country specific metadata will define what documentation on land rights will be counted as legally recognized (see next section for rationale).</p><p>Perceived security of tenure: Perception of tenure security refers to an individual\u2019s perception of the likelihood of involuntary loss of land, such as disagreement of the ownership rights over land or ability to use it, regardless of the formal status and can be more optimistic or pessimistic. Although those without land rights\u2019 documentation may frequently be perceived to be under threat, and those with documentation perceived as protected, there may be situations where documented land rights alone are insufficient to guarantee tenure security. Conversely, even without legally recognized documentation, individuals may feel themselves to be protected against eviction or dispossession. Therefore, capturing and analysing these diverse ranges of situations will enable a more comprehensive understanding of land tenure security, based on a country specific context.</p><p>For purposes of constructing the indicator (see next section for rationale), we define perceptions of tenure to be secure if:</p><p>(i) The landholder does not report a fear of involuntary loss of the land within the next five years due to, for example, intra-family, community or external threats and</p><p>(ii) The landholder reports having the right to bequeath the land.</p><p>Total adult population: A country\u2019s adult population is measured by census data or through surveys using an adequate sampling frame.</p><p>Interpretation:</p><p>One motivation that makes the indicator actionable is that, in many developing countries, the gap between data on the availability of documentation and on perception of tenure security can be large. For example, tenure may be perceived as secure, even though rights are not formally documented, as in the case of customary systems and trusted local land governance arrangements. Or, the opposite, tenure may be perceived as insecure even when there is a high level of formal documentation of rights. The latter situation can be caused by various factors, including limited trust in land administration services, possible duplicated documents, high cost of having state institutions protecting such rights.</p><p>Reporting on perceived security will provide important information on people\u2019s satisfaction with the institutional quality of service, transparency, appropriateness, accessibility and affordability of land administration services and justice systems.</p><p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p><p>The concepts below are based on the \u201cVoluntary Guidelines for the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Forests and Fisheries in the Context of National Food Security\u201d (shorthand VGGT), which were endorsed by the United Nations World Committee on World Food Security in 2012 and therefore considered an internationally accepted standard. Other international frameworks using these concepts are the African Union Agenda on Land as laid out in the 2009 Framework and Guidelines on Land Policy in Africa and the 2014 Nairobi Action Plan on Large-Scale Land-Based Investments.</p><p>Tenure: How people, communities and others gain access to land and natural resources (including fisheries and forests) is defined and regulated by societies through systems of tenure. These tenure systems determine who can use which resources, for how long, and under what conditions. Tenure systems may be based on written policies and laws, as well as on unwritten customs and practices. No tenure right, including private ownership, is absolute. All tenure rights are limited by the rights of others and by the measures taken by states for public purposes (VGGT, 2012).</p><p>Tenure typology: A tenure typology is country specific and refers to categories of tenure rights, for example customary, leasehold, public and freehold. Rights can be held collectively, jointly or individually and may cover one or more elements of the bundle of rights (the right of possession, of control, of exclusion, of enjoyment and of disposition).</p><p>Land governance: Rules, processes and structures through which decisions are made regarding access to and the use (and transfer) of land, how those decisions are implemented and the way that conflicting interests in land are managed.

Many tenure problems also arise because of weak land governance, disputes due to land acquisition or large-scale land-based investments, and attempts to address tenure problems associated with dualisms to tenure regimes. Responsible governance of tenure of land is inextricably linked with access to and management of other natural resources, such as forests, water, fisheries and mineral resources. The governance of tenure is a crucial element in determining if and how people, communities and others acquire rights, and their associated obligations, to use and control land and natural resources. Legal recognition to group tenure or adopting a \u2018fit for purpose\u2019 land administration and using these to recognize outer boundaries of land held under communal or customary arrangements have increasingly received government attention in the recent past.</p><p>Increasing demand for pro-poor land reforms has created the need for a core set of land indicators that have national application and global comparability, and culminated in SDG 1.4.2. Regular reporting on indicator 1.4.2 will provide an impetus to improve the availability of data from surveys as well as regularity of reporting on land administration service delivery to people by registries and other line agencies. Indicator 1.4.2 thus measures gender disaggregated progress in tenure security.</p><p>This indicator will inform policy and allow for the assessment of specific outcomes and practical priorities for further improvements of tenure security at the country level. Regular reporting on the two components of Indicator 1.4.2 will:</p><p>\u00b7 provide incentives for governments to improve performance on progress with responsible land governance</p><p>\u00b7 inform governments and non-state actors to what extent countries\u2019 legal and institutional frameworks recognize and support different land-tenure categories</p><p>\u00b7 provide information on implementation capacity to protect such rights in practice, as well as progress</p><p>\u00b7 identify the scope for additional action required at the country level as well as at a sub-national level or for certain categories, geographic entities or ecosystems, and</p><p>\u00b7 provide for equity between men and women in land rights.</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>Part (A): (All holders who own or inherited a land and have registered the land/All holders ) X 100</p><p>Part (B): (All holders who own or inherited a land and have not completely registered the land/All holders ) X 100</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>This data is disaggregated by sex, regions, rural and urban areas .</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p><a href=\"https://landportal.org/library/\">https://landportal.org/library/</a></p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-11-16","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-11-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/d130d7ec2ccee17081c379cec30be355f40e8da7","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Percentage (%)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":["SEX","URBANISATION"],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.1-4-2-title","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_name":"global_indicators.1-4-2-title","target_name":"global_targets.1-4-title","indicator_number":"1.4.2","un_designated_tier":"Tier II","un_custodian_agency":"World Bank (WB)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-04-02.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 4.0 MB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"Ghana Statistical Service (GSS)","source_periodicity_1":"TBA","source_earliest_available_1":2018,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://www.statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/fileUpload/pressrelease/Final%20Report%2011%2011%202020%20printed%20version.pdf","source_url_text_1":"Ghana Census of Agriculture (GCA), 2017/18","source_release_date_1":"September, 2020","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Official","source_contact_1":"info@statsghana.gov.gh","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"1.4.2","target_id":"1.4","sdg_goal":"1","indicator_sort_order":"01-04-02"},"1-5-1":{"SDG_GOAL":"<p>Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere</p>","SDG_TARGET":"<p>Target 1.5: By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters</p>","SDG_INDICATOR":"<p>Indicator 1.5.1: Number of deaths, missing persons and directly affected persons attributed to disasters per 100,000 population</p>","STAT_CONC_DEF":"<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p><p>This indicator measures the number of people who died, went missing or were directly affected by disasters per 100,000 population.</p><p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p><p>Death: The number of people who died during the disaster, or directly after, as a direct result of the hazardous event.</p><p>Missing: The number of people whose whereabouts is unknown since the hazardous event.
