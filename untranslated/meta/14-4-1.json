A<br/>stock can produce MSY if its abundance is above a certain level, usually around 50% of its unexploited<br/>abundance (but actual value can vary around that level, depending on the biological characteristics of the<br/>stock). See more at https://www.fao.org/faoterm/en/?defaultCollId=21<br/>MSY-based reference points are the most common type of reference points used in fisheries<br/>management today. This is primarily because, for decades, reference points from surplus production<br/>models have most often been set based on the concept of MSY and they are the basic benchmarks for<br/>the sustainability of fisheries set by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, Article 61(3)). For<br/>more on Reference Points in Fish Stock Assessment, see Caddy and Mahon (1995), Cadima (2003) or<br/>Haddon (2011).<br/>BMSY: Biomass corresponding to Maximum Sustainable Yield from a production model or from an age-<br/>based analysis using a stock recruitment model. Often used as a biological reference point in fisheries<br/>management, it is the calculated long-term average biomass value expected if fishing at FMSY.<br/>A population is: \u201cA group of individuals of the same species living in the same area at the same time and<br/>sharing a common gene pool, with little or no immigration or emigration.\u201d A biological stock is: \u201cA subpopulation of a species inhabiting a particular geographic area, having<br/>similar biological characteristics (e.g. growth, reproduction, mortality) and negligible genetic mixing with<br/>other adjacent subpopulations of the same species.\" (FAO, 2004-2021).<br/>The Reference List of Stocks: it is not possible to classify the sustainability of exploitation for all the<br/>exploited stocks from a country, region or the world. Therefore, the indicator must be calculated based<br/>on a subset of these stocks. The list of the stocks that are classified for status and used to calculate the<br/>indicators is called the \"Reference List of Stocks\".<br/>The Reference List of Stocks is built differently for the Regional/Global and the National levels. The<br/>process of building the Reference List of Stocks for regional and global level are described in FAO (2011).<br/>At National level, countries are requested to define a list of stocks, based on an agreed set of criteria<br/>(Appendix 1). National and shared stocks can be included, but not straddling stocks (stocks that are<br/>distributed both in national EEZ and Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction).<br/>At this moment, there is not a direct correspondence between the national level Reference Lists (that are<br/>defined by each country) and the regional and global Reference lists (that are defined by FAO).<br/>The detailed description of all necessary concepts can be found in the e-learning course (FAO 2019-2021).</p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Centimeter (cm) </p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development, 2021</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development</p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<p>Ghana statistical service</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>The United Nations (UN) Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA [UN, 1995]) and the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (FAO, 1995a) all require maintaining or restoring fish stocks at levels that are capable of producing their maximum sustainable yield (MSY). To fulfil the objectives of these international treaties, fishery management authorities need to undertake assessment of the state of fish stocks and develop effective policies and management strategies. As a UN Agency with a mandate for fisheries, FAO endeavours to provide the international community with the best information on the state of marine fishery resources. Since 1974, FAO has been periodically assessing and reporting the state of marine fishery resources using a wide spectrum of methods from numerical models to data poor approaches. FAO global and regional estimates were also used as an MDG indicator for Goal 7 on environment during the period 2000-2015. This facilitated its approval as a Tier I SDG indicator by the 2nd IAEG-SDG in October 2015. The indicator has a peculiar nature compared to more conventional SDG indicators. The indicator estimates the sustainability of fish stocks that often move across national boundaries. This led the indicator to be initially reported only at global and regional levels, with regions not corresponding to continental MDG or SDG regions but to marine regions termed \u201cFAO Major Fishing Areas\u201d. The Global SDG Indicator Framework is a voluntary mechanism, but countries are required to report if data are available. As a custodian agency, the FAO works to put in action the 2030 Agenda\u2019s emphasis on country ownership and higher the incentive to take actions at country, regional and global levels. FAO has developed, since 2018, a questionnaire approach to allow individual countries to report on the sustainability of fish stocks. The approach 1) provides a framework for meaningful country-level reporting that complements but does not alter the core methodology of SDG indicator 14.4.1 at the global/regional levels (FAO, 2011), and 2) provides countries with simplified methods to carry out fish stock assessment in data-limited contexts, to some extent overcoming the technical barriers that traditional methods presented. This is because country-level reporting will be limited to the assessment of stocks that are found only within a country\u2019s EEZ and/or shared with neighbouring countries\u2019 EEZs, and therefore do not include straddling stocks, highly migratory species, or stocks in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ). As a result, national data alone cannot be meaningfully aggregated at global/regional levels, but it can be used to inform country progress on fish stock sustainability within the EEZ. In 2019, the FAO began sending a questionnaire to countries to collect national data with the aim to help countries in the reporting process</p>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2022-10-10","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2022-10-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/sdg-ghana/data/commit/8b48184d7d6b6f550c672990684c4b8b7bf3b580","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"Centimetre(s)","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"global_indicators.14-4-1-title","graph_titles":"Mean length of fish species","graph_type":"line","indicator_name":"global_indicators.14-4-1-title","target_name":"global_targets.14-4-title","indicator_number":"14.4.1","un_designated_tier":"Tier I","un_custodian_agency":"Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-14-04-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (PDF 370 KB)","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"source_active_1":true,"source_organisation_1":"World Bank","source_periodicity_1":"Annual","source_earliest_available_1":2004,"source_geographical_coverage_1":"Ghana","source_url_1":"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY?locations=GB","source_url_text_1":"Poverty headcount ratio at $1.90 a day (2011 PPP) (% of population)","source_release_date_1":"28/05/2020","source_next_release_1":"TBA","source_statistical_classification_1":"Non-official","source_contact_1":"Research@WorldBank.org","source_active_2":false,"source_active_3":false,"source_active_4":false,"source_active_5":false,"source_active_6":false,"indicator":"14.4.1","target_id":"14.4","sdg_goal":"14","indicator_sort_order":"14-04-01"}
